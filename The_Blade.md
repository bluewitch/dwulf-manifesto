### Hekate
Hekate is the forger of the Code, JavaScript, through the browsers and Node.js, Python on the system, installed by default on Ubuntu 20.04, and  Rust, manually installed, and specific to all Substrate, Blockchain, development.

The system is ARM 64bit, not x86 64bit, which makes a diffrence when compiling Substrate with WASM, (which runs and compiles for x86).

Docker and other containerization technologies, and K8, allow to build containers, independent of our core operating system.  Git, allows us to update and push out our  codebase to our developers and open source public.
