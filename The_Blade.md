The is nothing new under the sun, everything in code and development is really just a more efficient way to develop and impliment code.

Libraries and Frameworks allow developers to impliment with fewer lines, working less with primitives and more with calling available libraries to do all the low level work such as managing the memory addresses and the respective literal values of primitives, and Frameworks which often times handles a whole new ecosystem, which sometimes have slightly nuanced syntax that require "transpilers" to interpret the syntax to JavaScript primitves in order to run correctly.
