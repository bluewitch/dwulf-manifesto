Here's the corrected and formatted version in Markdown:

The Book of Shadows
Dwolf Manifesto
Code is Law. It is the one central tenet of the order of the metal gods; there is no other law that has the power to state what it is and implement its direction. 

There is the human Writ of Law; while it has authority, it is too slow and too bureaucratic and can only enforce itself by inefficient means after the fact. Writ of Law does not have the capability to deal with any issue in real time. By the time we compile a new dApp and run its smart contract or software pallet, the Writ of Law was involved in... co-chairing the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the color of the book that regulation is in. They kept it gray.




There are those that do not concur with the mantra "Code is Law," to them, I say:
"Wolves don't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep."




First Principles

    Code primitives and first principles in BASH, JavaScript (NPM), Python (PIP3), and Rust (CARGO).

    Git fluency (all common commands):
        git add .
        git commit -m "message here"
        git push
        git pull
    Linux fluency with administration of NixOS, Ubuntu (Debian), Kali
