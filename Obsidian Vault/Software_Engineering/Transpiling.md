**Transpiling Explained & Converting Code to Rust**

**What is Transpiling?** Transpiling, a portmanteau of 'transformation' and 'compiling', is the process of converting the source code of a program written in one programming language into the source code of another programming language. This is different from compilation, where the end goal is typically to convert high-level source code into machine code or bytecode.

For instance, Babel is a popular JavaScript transpiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) into ES5 JavaScript, making it understandable for older browsers.

**Converting Other Code to Rust:** While Rust has its own unique syntax and paradigms, in many cases, it's feasible to convert or transpile code from languages like JavaScript or Python into Rust. This would involve:

1. **Analyzing the Source Code:** Before converting the code, one must understand its logic, data flow, and dependencies.
    
2. **Setting Up Rust Environment:** Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed and are familiar with Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool.
    
3. **Mapping Paradigms:** Not all paradigms from one language map directly to another. For instance, JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance would need a different approach in Rust, which doesn't have classes in the traditional OOP sense. Similarly, Python's dynamic typing will need to be mapped to Rust's static typing system.
    
4. **Translating Code:** Begin the process of rewriting the logic. For example:
   
_JavaScript:_

```javascript
function add(a, b) {     return a + b; }
```

_Rust:_

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {     a + b }
```
    
5. **Error Handling:** Rust's error handling is vastly different, using the `Result` and `Option` types, as opposed to traditional exceptions in languages like Python and JavaScript.
    

**Limitations:** While many algorithms and logic can be converted to Rust, certain files and configurations, like JSON or YAML, are not meant to be "converted" to Rust in the traditional sense. Instead, Rust interacts with them.

1. **JSON/YAML Configuration Files:** These are not programming languages but data representation formats. Instead of 'transpiling' them, you'd use Rust libraries (`serde` for JSON, for example) to parse and interact with these formats.
    
2. **Runtime Dynamism:** Languages like JavaScript have features determined at runtime, which might be hard to replicate in a statically-typed, compiled language like Rust.
    
3. **Library Dependencies:** If the original code relies on libraries exclusive to its ecosystem (like a specific npm package in JavaScript), you'll either need to find a Rust equivalent or implement the functionality yourself.
    
4. **Performance Considerations:** Transpiled code may not always be the most efficient. Rust's biggest strength lies in its memory safety guarantees without sacrificing performance. Directly transpiling might miss out on optimizing some of these benefits.
    

**Conclusion:** Transpiling from one language to another is no small feat. While it's feasible in many scenarios, certain constructs, paradigms, or dependencies in the source language might not have direct analogs in Rust. Furthermore, the real magic of Rust lies not just in its syntax but its ownership model, concurrency guarantees, and its ecosystem. When converting to Rust, it's essential to embrace its idioms fully for the best outcome.

# A Rust Overview and Options for a Transpiler
![Transpiler](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*K_phjhw2pehmtjb0teJ-pw.png)

Rust is the name of the Substrate and Astar game, the language that was chosen, to seal all the encroaching bugs that plague the development world of building blockchains. With Ink! and the Swanky Suite the language of choice is Rust of course, but, what if another or an easier (lazier) language is better known.

First we will review the benefits of Rust over, say C/C++, then we will explore deeper ideas such as transpilers to make our transition complete.

## Here is the benefits of Rust

Rust is a modern, safe, and efficient programming language that offers many benefits over C and C++. Here are some of the reasons why Rust is considered a better option:

1. Memory safety: Rust's ownership model and borrow checker ensure that there are no memory safety issues like null pointers, dangling pointers, or buffer overflows, which are common problems in C and C++.
2. Performance: Rust has similar performance characteristics to C and C++, but with safer and more efficient memory management.
3. Concurrency: Rust has built-in support for concurrency and parallelism, making it easier to write safe and performant multi-threaded code.
4. Expressiveness: Rust's modern syntax and powerful type system make it a more expressive and readable language than C or C++.
5. Ecosystem: Rust has a growing and vibrant ecosystem, with a package manager (Cargo) and many useful libraries and tools.

## What about those transpilers?

Regarding transpilers, Rust does not have a built-in transpiler, but it does have a foreign function interface (FFI) that allows it to call into and be called from other languages like C, C++, and Python. This means that you can use Rust code in conjunction with other languages and systems.

There are also some projects like Rust-Qt and Rust-SDL2 that provide Rust bindings to popular C++ libraries like Qt and SDL2, allowing you to use them from Rust. However, these are not true transpilers and still require you to write some C++ code.

In summary, Rust is a better option than C and C++ for many use cases because it provides memory safety, performance, concurrency, expressiveness, and a growing ecosystem. While there are no true transpilers to convert code from other languages to Rust, Rustâ€™s FFI and C++ bindings allow it to interoperate with other languages and systems.

## If it is good enough for Dr. Gavin Wood and Sota Watanabe, it is good enough for me

It was more a matter of following the best engineers working on the Blockchain. Dr. Gavin Wood, stepped down from his CEO role at Parity to become an active Architect for Polkadot. Sota Watanabe, has been diligent in his opinion of Rust and WASM bridges. Why not follow the leaders that are the best.

WASM bridges are the way to go, and Rust is the language to do it with. I feel they know what they are talking about, I have heard their arguments for making these choices and they are solid.

## Conclusion

Well it is of course best to learn Rust, it offers the strong advantages of a strongly typed language with no garbage collection artifacts. But the learning curve is there, and might be problematic and I get it.

I come from C/C++, but pointers and the hardships of the strictness of the language made me adopt a easier (lazier) language of JavaScript and Python. In my defense, it was mostly due to building rapid prototypes of working code, that I could just get out there. But now as I am older a wiser I realize the error of my ways, and in order to go forward, I must go backward, to the basics.

So here I am, more focused, and more forthright. All the unit testing and debugging has taught me if you want things done correctly, do it the right way the first time, and take the time that it needs or the Rust compiler will be your worst enemy.
