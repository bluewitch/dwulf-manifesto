A decentralized "blockchain" web systems.  No longer client-server of Web2, no more _username/password_ credentials required.  Your public crypto wallet hash and its private key to sign with, is your credential for the Web3.  Now bad actors will have to obtain your private key or crack the whole of encryption SHA256 that the Blockchain standard is based on.

Web3 is safer because (presumably), your [[mnemonic]] is centrally safe somewhere, there is no residual credential that can be scraped where a username/and password hash may be stored anywhere, a shadow directory where the hashes are.


The embodiment of Web3 derives from the concept of the Blockchain, but can be better fleshed out and be made more dynamically programmatic though development within the [[Polkadot Network]] [[Astar]], and the [[Ethereum Network]] by way of Parity's framework of [[Substrate]], and their smart-contract language [[Blockchain/Smart Contracts (Ink!)]].  Also  [[Solidity]] and the [[Smart Contracts (EVM)]] Ethereum Virtual Machine have legacy status in Web3 and have more projects involved with it.  So much so that [[Astar]] joined forces with [[Polygon Network]] to hammer out a [[zkEVM]].

# XcmSend
This is a new project I am working on, called [[XcmSend]], by my estimation it is built to drag-and-drop assets into a mixer


# RISC 0
[RISC Zero is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform based on zk-STARKs and the RISC-V](https://github.com/risc0/risc0)
