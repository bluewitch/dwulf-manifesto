𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝘆𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗱:  
  
𝟭. 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This forms the pyramid's base and should constitute most of your tests. Unit tests are quick to execute, easy to maintain, and focus on testing individual components or pieces of code in isolation (e.g., functions, methods). Their primary goal is to ensure that each piece of the code performs as expected.  
  
𝟮. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Sitting above unit tests, integration tests are fewer in number but critical for ensuring that different modules, APIs, or services work together as expected. These tests are slower than unit tests because they involve multiple components working together and often require more complex setup, such as database access or network calls.  
  
𝟯. 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Functional tests are the fewest in number at the pyramid's peak. These tests simulate user interactions with the application and verify that the system works as intended from an end-user perspective. Functional tests are the slowest to run and can be the most expensive to write and maintain due to their complexity and dependency on the user interface. When discussing functional testing, we usually include system testing, user acceptance testing, and regression testing.  
  
When we talk about some good practices regarding testing, here are a few:  
  
🔹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗻. Early software testing helps stop issues from developing later in the process when the expense of repairing them has already skyrocketed. The cost of fixing an issue decreases with early detection.  
  
🔹 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲. Automate repetitive and stable tests, especially at the unit and integration levels, to speed up the testing process and ensure consistency. However, decide wisely on what to automate, particularly at the functional testing level, to balance coverage and maintenance costs.  
  
🔹 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝘆𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗱. Ensure that most of your tests are unit tests, with fewer integration and high-level functional tests. This distribution helps maintain a fast and reliable testing suite.  
  
🔹 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆. Focus on writing meaningful tests that cover critical paths and functionalities rather than aiming for arbitrary coverage metrics. Quality tests accurately reflecting user scenarios and edge cases are more valuable than many superficial tests.
