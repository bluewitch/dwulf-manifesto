This is the procedure of the development part of [[Rust]], the link will present the language proper and the core of the language itself.

Once the Rust language is understood, the Rust Development (work-flow) will be in 2 parts, [[The Forge]], where all work is done and [[The Cradle]] where all the work is processed.  

The idea is to have Rust be a core of all systems or as many as realisticly possible.  Eventually, through [[Transpiling]], converting source code from a programming language, in our case, Python and JavaScript and into an equivalent source code of the Rust programming language.

Building the optimized development environment is exacting, Linux or Mac is the obvious choice, since most of the more serious code tools, like Docker, and Rust runs on Linux without  the need for helper applications.

[[LLVM]] is apart of the Rust system, and Rust Development and should be looked into also.

A detailed explanation about Rust and [[RAII]] Memory Management is important to know when exploring Rust

Getting started is simple, if you have access to your Linux terminal (I use Ubuntu/Debian):


```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```


# Rustlings

You should also go through Rustlings, to get your bearings in the Rust language.  It is different, and much more strict, and you must be mindful of memory.

# DevOp for Rust
It goes without saying that DevOp is a required skill for all development, for Rust or any other language.  To delve deeper [[DevOps]] is a good place to start.  Once that is understood, you will have half the fire power to become a elite Rust hacker.

The other half is the mastery of Rust and all of its dynamics

# Rust for the Blockchain
Most of the Rust development is going to be Blockchain related and [[Web3]] specific, in the Polkadot and Astar eco-systems.  [[Blockchain/Smart Contracts (Ink!)]] (the smart contract language created by Parity) and Swanky, (the assistive framework to interoperate with Ink!)  Also, of course to include [[Substrate]] frameworks developing para-chains from the mother ship (Polkadot) and creation of unique Pallets in FRAME.

This is not to say Rust is unable to be used in the [[Web2]] space, it can and is able to excel there.  Even in embedded firmware, it is a systems language that can be on the lowest level to the metal.  The core of the work is blockchain related, as our project matures we will delve into other areas for Rust

# Rust and Artificial Intelligence
With a language that is optimized against memory miss-allocations, it naturally follows that the development of Rust will be guided by, a A.I. Agent, co-pilot.

[[Artificial Intelligence]], and [[Rust]], is the best combination.

ChatGPT that is available to the public for a fee is a convenient but expensive choice, as we develop more mature data-sets for our own LLM, learn and customize it, we will be able to break away from the tit of ChatGPT, and roll our own.
