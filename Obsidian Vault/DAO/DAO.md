# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
A DAO is a pure, as the name implies a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.   This DAO model allows for proper abstraction between a user (human or agent) and the crypto wallet of the user or agent controls through the use of a mnemonic phrase, typically 12 words in the English language.

All wallets to the DAO must be, cold and air gapped, this is done to create plausible deniability of ownership, while still having the agency of stewardship over the assets of any given crypto wallet.  

This allows the user (human or agent), to coordinate a appropriate legal strategy to introduce legal tender fiat in their legal name or legal entity's name.  If they so choose and are required to do so otherwise this is the insulation between DeFi and CeFi

The end-game, is a DAO to have DAO inter-operation between all nodes and all blockchains where all wallets are given full autonomy and are only pseudo anonymous non-KYC by default.

# DAO Corpus
A DAO will most likely require a software body or _corpus_, from either a mosaic composite of [[Blockchain/Smart Contracts (Ink!)]] smart-contracts to a more formal and internal functionality of a Substrate Pallet in a Substrate FRAME.  Some core Substrate functionality is a requirement and the only limit is truly the imagination of the programmer of the DAO and the gas or core-time availability to transact on the chain.

[[BTC (Bitcoin)]], has a special place in any DAO, and a DAO would be wise to have a peer-2-peer system like [[Bisq]], embedded into its corpus along with [[Decentralized EXchanges (DEX)]] for alt-coins.  In most cases, actual BTC may be exchanged for a software wrapped BTC ($iBTC) equivalent, the reason is BTC is non-turing and proof of work, and its registers are the only way to program BTC, in order to interoperate with alt-coin networks, such as Ethereum and Polkadot.  

A Bitcoin Node, like [[MyNode]], which can be run on a Raspberry Pi, can service $BTC and $LTC, and Monero $XMR, but is restricted to just a few OG coins because the other alt-coin networks were not evolved yet.  Now they are. 

Although [[Ethereum Network]] has more legacy, and reach, it also has more legacy costs and vulnerable language tools, like [[Solidity]].  The main pain point in the [[Ethereum Network]], is the gas costs to transact on the [[Smart Contracts (EVM)]]. So our focus is on The [[Polkadot Network]] (layer 0) relay-core, and the [[Astar]] (layer 1) para-chain, built with [[Substrate]] and programmed in [[Rust]] are the software components for the DAO.  But the DAO itself can be more, functionally, than the sum of these programmatic parts either in its own corpus or vicariously by way of other DAOs.  The totality of the DAO is the essence of [[Web3]] applications and the new decentralized systems.

# The Organization of the DA

Any DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a type of organization that is run by a set of rules encoded as computer programs, in Substrate this is known as pallets and/or smart contracts, on a blockchain. Here are some of the components of a Organization of the DA:

1. **Token holders:** The members of the DAO may hold coin/tokens of its own chain (para-chain) that represent their share of ownership and voting power in the organization. If not distributed through a air drop or a investment allocation, the coin/tokens are typically bought on an exchange that exchanges them or peer-2-peer, in person, or earned by contributing (onchain or offchain) to the DAO which can include direct contributions of assets, or voluntary help and support for the DAO, writing articles, showcasing media, etc. Of course tokens are sometimes considered coins. the real difference between coins and tokens is coins are made to be more a economic interface, meant to have a value for trading and tokens are like voting ballots for the governance system and that is not to say that the tokens cannot be impactful in the economic sense as votes and referendums, can modify the DAO's exchange rate and payout from its treasury.  Other tokens, can be NFT, with a unique hash for that one token useful for legal titles, deeds, and registration documents.

2. **Pallets**, **FRAMES**, **Smart contracts:** The rules of the DAO are encoded in software and can come in the forms of Pallets/FRAMES, and smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs that are stored on a blockchain. These software commands either through pallets or smart contracts are able to govern the behavior of the DAO, including voting, fund management, and membership. Another program item in Substrate is a pallet which is more tightly integrated into the DAO, often holding the internal and sometimes exclusive functions such as Governance or the Treasury and maybe even a integrated DeFi exchange or mixer. The real difference between pallets and smart contracts is pallets are a permanent and embedded feature to the DAO, smart contracts can apply a one time on the fly function on the DAO interfaced through APIs and data intrinsic.

3. **Governance system:** A proper DAO should have a governance system pallet that allows token holders that are more accurately token ballots, to propose, vote on, and implement changes to the DAO organization. This may include decisions about fund allocation, membership rules, removing `sudo` pallet that gives root admin override options and other aspects of the DAO’s operations.

4. **Treasury (Vault):** The DAO should always have a treasury that holds funds (including proprietary coins or digital coin assets from other Blockchains) that are used to support the organization’s activities. Token holders may vote on how these funds are allocated, such as for development, marketing, or other expenses.  A _Vault_ is a subset of the _Treasury_ and is typically embedded within the Treasury as a fiscal benchmark for capital price settlement and assets in the sub component of the Treasury are scrubbed (exchanged for [[Monero]]), mixed (through a [[Crypto Mixer]]), and put into a fresh wallet with Stable Coin (or user's desired digital asset)

5. **Decentralized decision-making:** The DAO operates on a decentralized basis, meaning that decisions are made by consensus of the token holders rather than by a arbitrary centralized authority. This allows for greater transparency and participation in the decision-making process.

6. **Reputation system:** The DAO may have a identity, also referred to as a DID or [[Decentralized ID]], (borrowed from the Kilt parachain?) that serves as a brand reputation system that incentives members to act in the best interests of the organization. This may include mechanisms such as rewarding positive contributions (like staking rewards) or penalizing negative actions (like slashing coin/tokens from those rewards).

These are some of the key components of any DAO, including the GreenWitchDAO, but the specifics may vary depending on the particular organization and its goals.

# GreenWitchDAO
This is a DAO with an identifier, code named "Greenwitch", more details about the [[GreenWitchDAO]] are in the link.  The GreenWitchDAO builds on the skeleton of just a DAO by also grafting and incorporating 5 A.I. agents that service and attend the GreenWitchDAO.  Each A.I. agent has a role in the proper administration of the GreenWitchDAO ensuring that the DAO and its user's crypto wallets are properly insulated from the [[Old World Economy]], where dragons be.

# Tax Avoidance, Not Tax Evasion

### **Using a DAO to Avoid Legal Ownership & Liability while Retaining Control**

**1. Structure of the DAO:**

- **Smart Contracts**: These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. A DAO is essentially a collection of smart contracts, generally on a platform like Ethereum and Polkadot.
    
- **Members**: In a DAO, members are usually token holders. These tokens can grant voting rights or other privileges. The distribution method (purchase, earn, etc.) should be determined.
    

**2. Self Sovereign Wallets:**

- **Definition**: A self-sovereign wallet allows users to have complete control over their assets. Private keys are held only by the user, ensuring complete control and access to their funds.
    
- **Linking with DAO**: Members of the DAO will use their self-sovereign wallets to interact with the DAO’s smart contracts. This ensures that they can vote, propose changes, or engage in transactions.
    

**3. Legal Ownership & Liability Avoidance Mechanisms:**

- **Anonymous Proposals**: Implement mechanisms where proposals can be made anonymously. Using zk-SNARKs or other privacy tools can enable this.  Do not put personal meta-data on your signing keys, no KYC/AML.  De-centralized ID, may be an option if the user wants to promote a brand as an identifier or to receive delegation from other users.
    
- **Asset Control without Ownership**: The DAO's structure allows assets to be held by the organization DAO (under control of the pallet or the smart contract in play) rather than by individuals bound by nation-state restrictions. This can provide a layer of separation between the individual and the assets, disrupting the tax liability of "ownership" but retaining stewardship "control" of any assets, even though rule of law offers entities to do this already, i.e. LLC, Trust, Foundations, and CoOps, it's not guaranteed to avoid legal scrutiny, but it helps to have contingencies in play.
    
- **Proxy Contracts**: Create proxy contracts to interact with other external contracts. This allows for an added layer of separation of church of the nation-state and the state of your financial anonymity.
    
- **Dispute Resolution**: Integrate decentralized arbitration methods, escrow like Kleros or Aragon Court, to handle internal disputes without resorting to traditional legal systems.
    

**4. DAO to DAO Transactions for P2P Privacy:**

- **Whitelisting DAOs**: Only approved DAOs can interact with your DAO. This ensures a trusted network of peer DAOs and limits exposure to untrusted or unknown entities.  The public hash can be used as a identifier to credit "trust", but Decentralized IDs will build a better brand. 
    
- **Private Transaction Layers**: Use privacy solutions like zk-Rollups, zk-SNARKs, or zk-STARKs to ensure transaction details (like amount, parties involved) remain confidential.
    
- **Inter-DAO Protocols**: Standardize protocols for DAO-to-DAO interactions to ensure seamless and private transactions.
    
- **Atomic Swaps**: For asset exchanges between DAOs, atomic swaps (teleporting) can be a good option. They ensure that the transaction either completes successfully for both parties or doesn’t occur at all, reducing all counter-party risk.
    

**5. Potential Risks and Concerns:**

- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Even with these mechanisms in place, regulatory bodies (that still exist and have teeth) might still find ways to associate DAO activity with individuals, through voodoo heuristics of 3rd parties, especially if there's suspicion of wrongdoing.
    
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: The DAO’s structure and transactions depend on the integrity of smart contracts, which can have vulnerabilities. While all Smart-Contracts will be developed using Rust with compiler optimized memory management, but still Regular audits are still essential to completely trace and test the code.
    
- **Ethical Implications**: Bypassing traditional legal systems and ownership norms might lead to misuse or unintended consequences.  It is important to be aware of this and to build a better system than the one that is being bypassed.  

- Make the counter-measures, count.
