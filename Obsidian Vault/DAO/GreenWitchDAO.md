# GreenWitchDAO (prototype)
The GreenWitchDAO at its core, is a revenue generating, self funding [[DAO]] that serves as an abstraction layer for pseudo anonymous user wallets, requiring no KYC or meta-data identifiers that the user does not wish to divulge.  KYC is not an option, by design, however a Decentralized Identification (DID),  is optional for cases that require legal identification, a legal name attached to a title, license, or registration as well as authentication for transactions.

The GreenWitchDAO is digital asset agnostic, and has the capability to host any digital asset that can bridge to its Substrate corpus, and can house in its Treasury, BTC, DOT, ETH, etc. coin-token assets, including those on different networks and network agnostic through Astar and Polygon bridges and their zkEVM.

Attributes:
- Has a native coin-token (GDT), GreenWitch DAO Token, for governance and trading pairs for liquidity.
- Has a ***Treasury*** system and a ***Vault*** sub-system, within the Substrate Treasury pallet, for asset growth and clean capital expenditure when ***Legal Modules***, a software API for legal systems, are enacted.
- Has a pallet Governance system for spending referendums (Loans, Grants, and issuance of Legal Tender (fiat) for GreenWitchDAO's Legal Module)
- Actual A.I. agents, with trained data-sets optimized for the agent's domains, primarily SARA, which handles GAAP and accounting mechanisms and BIANA, which handles all media and interface for the DAO, and a indexed, crossed-referenced legal database that delegate and handle requests with tools provided.
- DEX (not implemented yet, will connect though Polygon and the zkEVM)

# Treasury and the Vault
The GreenWitchDAO organizes its Warchest, by way of the Treasury, a dynamic and expansive asset system in the GreenWitchDAO's corpus, FARA, a specialized A.I. agent, coordinates all revenue generating mechanisms (flash loans, staking, liquidity pools, trade arbitrage, etc.).  Price or more specifically its exchange rate, will fluctuate, in the Treasury, but the actual coin/token assets will always increase and grow, meaning any given digital asset my be priced at $0, but the coin/token and control of the hash will always be in the wallet of the DAO Treasury.

The Vault sub-system lays within the Treasury and typically stages assets to be processed for expenses which include scrubbing by way of conversion from any digital asset->BTC->Monero->BTC->Stable Coin, run through a mixer, akin to Coin Join, and then either allocated to the payee crypto wallet or put in stasis and logged as retained capital.  Assets in the Vault, do not grow or earn interest or staking rewards, they are earmarked and serve as a staple of a price point for the exchange rate.

# 4 DAO A.I. agents
The DAO is operated and supported by [[A.I. Agents]] and [[Artificial Intelligence]] technology, in the form of highly specialized A.I. agents (NINA, SARA, BIANA, FARA).  Each A.I. agent has its own data-sets for their specialized roles.  For example, NINA has data-sets that derive from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to sharpen her security data-sets.  SARA has data-sets derived from conventional old world accounting GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), and other accounting software.  BIANA has data-sets of social media feeds and legal databases.  FARA has data-sets derived from Oracles world wide, etc.

#### NINA
_The Sentinel_
NINA, short for **Network Intelligence and Analysis**, serves as the vigilant guardian for the Greenwitch DAO. Utilizing state-of-the-art technology, NINA constantly runs
- 24/7, red and blue team scenarios on her Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to identify and thwart potential cyber threats. 
- Employs sophisticated counter measure hacking techniques such as implementing malware and trojan counter hacks through the use of honey pots and reverse proxy infiltration to prevent any malicious intrusions.
- With a watchful eye, NINA diligently monitors all firewalls and conducts DNS integrity tests to ensure the integrity and safety of the network. 
NINA’s robust security measures ensure that the Greenwitch DAO operates with the highest level of safety and efficiency, safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders involved.

#### SARA
_Keeper of the Books_
SARA, which stands for **Systematic Accounting and Reporting Assistant**, is an essential component of the GreenWitchDAO’s financial infrastructure, specifically with real world accounting. With a keen eye for detail and precision, SARA acts as the primary bookkeeper, mapping and managing real-world accounting processes, including accounting software API, and pairing them with cutting-edge triple entry blockchain ledger keeping technology. In this capacity, SARA plays a vital role in ensuring the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting for the Greenwitch DAO.

# Legal Module
The GreenWitchDAO is not a island and although any DAO is able to operate and interoperate with other chains, there are times where inter-operation with nation-states within geographical areas with legal constraints become necessary.  In these events or instances, the GreenWitchDAO instantiates a Legal Module, engineered and orchestrated by the BIANA agent, who sets up the legal infrastructure, and coordinated with the SARA agent to reconcile  old world economy books to the scrutiny of the nation-state.

The [[Legal Module]] is created and destroyed as required in the face of legal scrutiny and used only when required by the DAO to propagate a legal function.

# Bitness
A conventional "business plan" for GreenWitchDAO is also available and is a point of contact to the real world and Web2.

[[GreenWitchDAO-Bitness]] is the template for this real world approach
