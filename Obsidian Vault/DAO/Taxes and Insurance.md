Both Taxes and Insurance fall under the same centralized bondage system.  Agents of DAOs consider all taxes, or more readily income taxes from the DAO and how they are calculated at the time of realization when fiat is realized and crosses into either a doxxed human wallet or a centralized bank, irrespective of actual law or statutes.

For the DAO, which is not bound to any nation-state rule of law, this means nothing, for the doxxed nation-state citizen who has KYC'ed and indexed their social security number or taxID to legally claim ownership of any digital assets, and by proxy the tax liability, it is important to balance the equation.

For insurance it is slightly different, but still centralized, but a smart-contract of a insurance service can be minted and if a certain onchain conditions are met, a onchain condition can be like a wallet balance drained of a insured wallet, a claim and a payout is automatically put forth, most likely from the treasury of the insurance chain and liquidity pool.

With insurance on the chain, and a smart-contract in play for that insurance system to be on chain, what ever triggers the payout through the network (i.e. A.I. agent reads and verifies through sentiment analysis of a drought in a farming region or a registered police report on public record, for a totaled vehicular collision, for example.)

In the old world, social security, drivers license, utility bills would be required to obtain insurance, but in the new world it will simply be minted as an dynamically programmed NFT that executes the transactions and payouts directly to the crypto wallet that it is minted with.  No KYC required, just control of the wallet in a peer-to-peer transaction.

# Income Taxes

For the human user of a nation-state, or the human user that pays taxes, this will be much harder to trace and identify and depending on the user's patience for piecing together trade and transactions to compose their books for the IRS even without the IRS having a real way to validate the books outside of depending on the heuristics of their Chainalysis thugs they hired to read the binary tea leaves, unless KYC'ed or indexed in some way.

Because of this, for the A.I. agent that manages the DAO, income tax (or any tax other than the gas for the transaction) is simply off the table, and on the chain, the only tax the agent cares about  is the actual processing cost (i.e. gas tax) that is necessary for the electricity required for transaction to commit, and maybe a transaction fee from the chain providing the actual transaction service if the user's DAO has no exchange in its corpus.  

Isolating and documenting transactions, keeping track of buy and sell date-time stamps to determining price points of acquisition to determine proper tax rates of gains or losses and the IRS scrutiny of declared on off fiat takes  just too much to expect from any human user and A.I. agent users simply has no reason to even consider it.

# Sanctioned Onboarding

That is why onboarding is done surgically and with precision and special care is made to build out a wallet corner-stone for the user.  Any and all income is portaled through a DAO interface, and put into the user controlled treasury until the user along with their A.I. agent is able to determine a proper exit and tax mitigation strategy to realize funds through legal channels.  Through their governmental identity, or the entity of their decentralized brand.

# Granularity of centralized requirements

It is possible for a A.I. agent to cherry pick centralized optimizations as required and as needed.  For example, an insurance payout to a instantiated legal entity, created by the A.I. agent, made to convert legal tender to crypto asset of choice.

A human, tax payer receiver of a salary will require the DAO to instantiate FARA for capital sourcing, SARA for conventional bookkeeping and payroll automation.  BIANA for HR roles and tax mitigation. 

A anonymous user, is simply a peer-to-peer transaction.

The DAO orchestrates the treasury through its A.I. agents; FARA, SARA, and BIANA, the treasury is multi-sig, each agent holds a key, 3 are needed to sign for a transaction.

To the DAO all capital, in its treasury is not taxable until realized by a doxxed user and their doxxed wallet.
