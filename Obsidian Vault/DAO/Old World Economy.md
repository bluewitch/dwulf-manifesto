The old world money ministers and the old guard for the dying empires.  The Old World Economy is dead, it just doesn't know it yet as the systemic hemorrhaging corruption of even legally sanctioned banks and financial institutions along with centralized crypto exchanges compounded with actual certified bad actors make it impossible for the typical user to know the difference between who can be trusted and who tells the truth. 

The Regulators, SEC, IRS, Federal Reserve, BIS, WEP, FATF and others are apart of the old world economy, money, the legal tender, fiat, that used to be controlled and indexed by the artifacts of the old world cannot create rule of law fast enough to maintain their grip on the new world's economy, the "Code is Law" sentiment will always trump the Rule of Law...every time.

# Old World Economy: Entanglements
It is a basic fact that the Old World Economy has been active for at least 3 to 4 generations, meaning whole lifetime cycles of being born, living, and dying has been going on, and all the false teachings have been "indoctrinated" to the citizens of the nation-states.

So the method of money has been arbitrarily put out to the citizens and many aspects of legal tender has given way to common place among the citizens.

Make no mistake, the money system as it is today is engineered to keep the nation-state citizens poor or impoverished, this is done in order to keep control of the masses through social benefits packages bread and circuses.

In order to keep control of the wealthier citizens of the nation-state, business owners, and other professionals requires the legal and mental gymnastics to be the loyal pet of the nation-state.  Capital printed by the nation-state is the debt that will keep everybody in the chains of poverty both the common and the wealthy.

Systems of centralized capital management, bank accounts, credit cards, W2 employment, 1099 contracting, mortgages, conventional centralized exchange accounts, both conventional money markets, stocks and bonds.  Centralized crypto exchanges (where you surrender ownership of your private keys to them), is the new breed that the nation-state wants to corrupt to become a CBDC and have total control over the nation-state citizens.

Make no mistake, the Old World Economy is dying.  But we are within its dying world.
