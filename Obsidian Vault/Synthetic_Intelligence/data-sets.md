A.I. agents at their root are a refined collection of data that are organized in the form of data-sets.  From data-sets, training can be use to allow the agent to clarify the probability of more accurate determinations of correctness and truth.

LLM or Large Language Models, are apart of this allowing the agent to better comprehend and elaborate queries from the user.  Based on the user prompts and how they are asked.

Experienced software developers could very well ask a better formatted question or request to a LLM, allowing a more specific and easy to follow output to be produced.  Where a novice developer could ask for the same thing but in a less deterministic way and get more ambiguous results that may even be hallucinations and false data.

Because of this, initial prompts must be optimized and tempered with experienced human users to make the most of building premium data-sets.
