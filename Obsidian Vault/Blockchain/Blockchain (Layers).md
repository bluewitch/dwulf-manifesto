The Blockchain ledger is the corner-stone of the [[DAO]], the Blockchain could be considered a primitive for a DAO, since the Blockchain is literally the greatest record keeping truth machine ledger there is.  From a simple linked-list to an eternal chain of truth for all transactions.

The Blockchain, itself, is the ledger, and also has layers/levels that indicate a additional layer of software abstraction and inter-operation.  The BTC blockchain ledger is limited to switching of software registers for non-turing functionality (such as creating ordinals or coloured BTC).  The layers from 1 onward provide more functionality and full turing dynamics of crypto assets (staking, yield farming, flash loans, etc.)

âœ… Primary Function 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 0: Acts as a framework to facilitate interoperability and connectivity between different Layer 1 blockchains.  This is the area where Parity's Substrate framework reside, Polkadot being formally a layer 0 foundation

ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: (`sbin`) Foundation of blockchain networks.   Polkadot para-chains and Ethereum EVM reside here.   Astar is considered a Layer 1 ecosystem, as it is layered ontop of Polkadot's Layer 0, which in turn is hosts to a dApps as a Layer 2.

ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: (`bin`) Built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and efficiency.  Here more abstractions allow more scalability in the form of dApps and smart-contracts.

âœ… Processing Transactions 
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 0: Provides a cross-chain architecture that allows multiple Layer 1 networks (aka para-chains) to scale and interact more efficiently.
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Handles transactions natively on the blockchain.  In the Pokadot ecosystem, mostly through extrinsics with XCM/XCMP.  
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Processes transactions off the main chain to reduce congestion.  zkEVM, WASM, PVM. 

âœ… Scalability 
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 0: Enables different blockchain networks to communicate and transfer value or data seamlessly, essentially allowing them to be interoperable.
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Scalability improvements involve changes to the protocol itself, no hard forks, updates are auto-magically done.  Most Substrate pallets are here.
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Increases scalability without altering the base layer.  Most Ink! and Swanky smart-contracts are here.

âœ… Security 
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 0: Security relies on the collective strength of interconnected networks, with each blockchain adding to the overall resilience of the system.
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Security is integral, maintained by the network's consensus mechanism. 
- ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Leverages the security of Layer 1 but requires additional measures to ensure integrity. 

âœ… Examples 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 0: Polkadotâ€™s Relay Chain, Cosmosâ€™s Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol.
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Bitcoin, Ethereum. 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Lightning Network (for Bitcoin), Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups (for Ethereum). 

âœ… Cost 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Can have high transaction fees due to network congestion. 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Generally offers lower transaction costs by handling transactions off-chain. 

âœ… Speed 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Transaction speed is limited by the block time and network congestion. 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Provides faster transaction throughput by offloading the work from the main chain. 

âœ… Development Complexity 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 0: Offers a high degree of flexibility, enabling developers to build customized Layer 1 blockchains with specific features or consensus mechanisms designed to work in a wider ecosystem.
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Requires in-depth protocol knowledge and broad consensus to update. 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Developers can innovate more freely, often without needing broad network consensus. 

âœ… Use Cases 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Ideal for secure, decentralized transactions and settlements. 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Suitable for micropayments, gaming, and quick transfers. 

âœ… Upgradeability 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: Upgrades can be challenging and require network-wide agreement (forks). 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Solutions can be upgraded with less friction and without impacting the underlying blockchain. 

âœ… User Experience 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 1: May face challenges with slower transaction times and higher fees. 
ðŸŽ¯ Layer 2: Often focuses on creating a smoother user experience with fast and cheap transactions.

By understanding all three layers â€“ Layer 0, Layer 1, and Layer 2 â€“ we can appreciate the full spectrum of blockchain architecture, which collectively drives forward the vision of a decentralized and interconnected digital economy. Each layer has a critical role, whether it's establishing a solid foundation, enhancing performance, or bridging networks to work cohesively.
