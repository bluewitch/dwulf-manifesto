The Craft and known aka., The Way.  The Craft and the way are one in the same, and is the mystical ceremony of the developer.  The method of understanding the language is agnostic, but the practices are always the best.

Witches practice the Craft with tools of magick and their body divine.

Most witch cults invite anybody and everybody, men or women, and anything in-between, to become a member of its coven.  A few, like the Dianic cult are exclusively female.

# The Dianic Cult
The Dianic cult of witches are so fanatical that they have strict protocols of allowing only female born (i.e. being born with and having a physical vagina and uterus) into their sisterhood coven.  All males are forbidden to be apart of the cult, and even male to female transvestites / transsexuals are not allowed into the coven, as they are male born, however female to male transsexuals may be given a place in the cult, as they are born female, the coven does not discriminate as long as the pledge is born female, female to male transitioners who get surgery to remove ovaries and have genitals augmented as a penis may be allowed in but with a lesser status.

The reason for this strict adherence to female born requirement is uncertain, but is said to be tied to magick of ovaries and the natural menstrual cycle and a firm belief that the woman is the portal from the spirit world to the material world through the miracle of birth of mortal babies.

Almost all Dianic cult witches are, not surprisingly all  lesbian however a few are bisexual and almost none are heterosexual.



# Witchwood Lesbian Witch Cult

Deep within the witchwood, on a midsummars eve, female madiens in the nude danced about the pyre of the large fire.  They dance, they prance, and their voices carry on the wind throughout the bay area, to find male ears to harken to their calls.

The ceremony is always on this lone island, in a bay area.  No one knows the exact location of the island in the bay, it is on no modern maps.

Men who are in earshot and harken to the madien's call must make a saving throw vs magic or be com-pulsed to goto the source of the enchanted calls and eventually seduced to have intercourse with them and participate in the Orgy of Dionysus, a 28 day orgy ritual that turns men into impotent shemales.

The stories and rumors of wanton sexual debauchery on the witchwood island, cannot be verified as no man that has stepped foot on the island has never been seen again...at least not the same.

It is told that men that dance with the witch maidens, under a blood red moon, undergo a transformation through pleasure and promise.

A mystical "sex change", takes place as the male begins to feminize but never completely become female.

The sex is always pleasurable and satisfying, but always with a cost, a man's vitae for the sacrifice to the insanity of lust.  Every day of the enchanted sexual intercourse will transform and mutate the man to have feminine characteristics.  

Only 28 sessions can ever be taken by a male, each one more addictive than the last.  Every session will inflict a 3.6% tranny transformation.  In the early stages the changes can be very subtle, up to a 33% men can still look like men up to then.
