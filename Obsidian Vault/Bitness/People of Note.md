This is a list of more focused "contacts", that are more related to the goals of the GreenwitchDAO. 

I divided this into, very important professionals, VIPs and Hall of Heros.  VIPs are people related directly to the chain industry and DAO related activities, they are not necessarily my personal heros, but they are important.

Hall of Heros, are people, living, dead and fictional that I resonate with.  Living and fictional show their picturis in colour, dead is in black and white


# VIPs

Dr. Gavin Wood
![](hero_gavin_wood.jpg)
The one and only, creator of Ethereum's Solidity and Polkadot's Substrate.  Would like to meet him someday, he probably doesn't even know I exist.
