### Polkadot JAM Warchest Requirements: Building a Regenerative DAO Treasury

**Overview**  
A warchest is a financial reserve specifically set aside for sustaining and growing DAO operations. It covers everything from daily administration and logistics to funding projects and navigating unforeseen challenges. In the context of DAOs on Polkadot JAM, warchests provide a self-sovereign, regenerative funding mechanism to ensure independence, scalability, and resilience.

The DAO’s financial ecosystem is divided into multiple layers of reserves, each serving a distinct function: **Dry Powder (Petty Cash)** for immediate liquidity, and three regenerative warchests—**Alpha, Beta, and Omega**—for long-term operational and investment strategies. The regenerative layers are designed to produce daily yields while maintaining operational liquidity within specific time-lock parameters.

### **Breaking Down the Warchest Layers**

1. **Dry Powder (Petty Cash)**  
    Dry Powder represents the DAO’s immediately accessible liquidity, kept in $BTC to maintain confidence in decentralized assets over fiat or stablecoins.
    
    - **Purpose**: Emergency expenses and short-term liquidity (24-hour availability).
    - **Limitations**: Holds only 4% of the total treasury, earning no yield.
    - **Utility**: Acts as a rapid-response fund for operational disruptions, ensuring seamless continuity of operations.
2. **Regenerative Warchests**  
    These layers produce compounding yields, balancing operational funding with long-term growth.
    
    - **Warchest Alpha**:
        
        - **Denomination**: $DOT (staked through Nova Wallet).
        - **Purpose**: Covers logistics, expansions, and mobile operations.
        - **APY**: 16%, yielding 1.3 $DOT daily (~$16.75).
        - **Time-Lock**: 28 days for liquidation.  
            Alpha provides medium-term operational stability, ensuring up to three months of DAO sustainability.
    - **Warchest Beta**:
        
        - **Denomination**: $ASTR (staked on Astar).
        - **Purpose**: Investment fund for business ventures such as Neurolanche and Nova Wallet.
        - **APY**: 11%, yielding 46 $ASTR daily (~$6).
        - **Time-Lock**: 10 days for liquidation.  
            Beta focuses on funding growth-centric DAO initiatives, including R&D through Greenwitch Labs and Astar’s dApp ecosystem.
    - **Warchest Omega**:
        
        - **Denomination**: $DOT (staked via Bifrost for liquid staking).
        - **Purpose**: High-yield reserve for professional-scale DAO enterprises.
        - **APY**: 17%, yielding 2.5 $DOT daily (~$22).
        - **Time-Lock**: 28 days, with a 0-day option (for a fee).  
            Omega serves as the DAO’s ultimate financial shield, used only for large-scale investments or last-resort capital.

### **Integrating Polkadot JAM and Warchests for U.S. BizDev and DevRel**

The **Polkadot JAM campaign** aims to expand Polkadot’s presence in the U.S. by leveraging the regenerative funding mechanism of warchests to fuel BizDev and Developer Relations (DevRel) initiatives. Here’s how:

- **BizDev Focus**: The Alpha Warchest funds operational expenses for outreach programs, partnerships, and marketing campaigns targeting U.S.-based crypto-friendly merchants and developers.
- **DevRel Focus**: The Beta Warchest provides investment capital for creating technical education resources, hackathons, and Polkadot JAM SDK adoption programs, accelerating developer onboarding.
- **Decentralized Growth**: Omega Warchest resources back large-scale professional engagements, such as incubating high-potential startups building on Polkadot.

Polkadot JAM, when paired with a well-structured warchest strategy, ensures that DAOs can sustain operations while scaling their influence and adoption in a targeted market. By combining self-sovereign treasury management with regenerative finance, the initiative embodies the ethos of decentralization while addressing practical business needs.
