A Warchest is the resources required for warfare; in our case, expenses for administration, daily operations, and logistics are from the warchest and funding for projects on the DAO are requisitioned as required.

The Warchest capital repository for the DAO's operations, are in the **Treasury** repository and the sub-repository of the **Vault** within the Treasury.

There are 4 warchest layer accounts with most assets invested and producing daily yields.  Unstaking them puts the assets on a 10-28 day time-lock, meaning the assets unlocked and unstaked cannot be obtained before then and are in stasis.

- Warchest Apha: Defense Fields

# Dry Powder(Petty Cash):

Dry Powder is for immediate (within 24hours) liquidity, also known as "petty cash" 

Dry Powder:
- 0% APY
- $0 USD value
- Stored as $BTC
- No daily yields

Dry Powder has deterministic funds (in Vault), typically, no more than 4% of the total Warchest Treasury amount can be immediately available.   Liquid capital with a max of 24 hour time-lock (typically the time of all network transfers to convert to BTC and fiat).  Dry Powder is typically kept in the form of $BTC until conversion to fiat is required.

The reason it is stored as $BTC as opposed to stable coin tethered to the USD is because of the lack of confidence in all fiat.  No hacker anarchist in their right mind would even consider otherwise.

This is currently about a months salary and is for immediate emergencies. 

Note iBTC:
Pure $BTC does not have any software wrapper by itself to interoperate in the EVM or Polkadot Substrate environments, so on Polkadot Substrate a para-chain $iBTC will allow a bridge-less way to safely and securely shift over your $BTC so you can earn yields on $BTC, otherwise it is just a store of value.

**Regenerative Warchests:**
The next 3 warchests are what is called "regenerative", meaning they produce daily yields and as a consequence and trade off for having the benefit of being regenerative are not immediately available, typically having time-locks between 10-28 Blockchain cycles (days) 

Yields are compounded.

**Warchest Alpha:**
- 18% APY
- $6,000 USD value
- Denomination: $DOT
- Yields 0.5 $DOT daily ($3.75/day)

Warchest Alpha is the first line of defense and primary capital for expansion of business expeditions and logistics, expenses for base of operations and mobile operations.  Current staking is through [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/),  and requires a 28 day time-lock to liquidate and become available.

Warchest Alpha, wallet can endure 3 months living expense before being depleted.

**Untouchables (Beta and Omega)** 

Beta and Omega Warchests are, typically, out of scope for administrative and daily expenses and cannot be used for anything other than business and enterprise investments.

Their values can be borrowed against in over collateralized loans no more than 1/3 of the total value locked, (i.e. $10,000 locked, will enable $3,333 available for a internal, interest free, loan.)

**Warchest Beta:**
Pros
- 11% APY
- $15,000 USD value locked
- Denomination: $ASTR
- Yields 46 $ASTR daily ($6/day)
Cons
- 10 day time-lock to liquidate (actual principle)

Primary capital for the business investments division of the DAO, which currently include: **Neurolanche**, **Nova Wallet**, and **Greenwitch R&D**.  Current staking is on Astar dApp(s), and requires a 10 day time-lock to liquidate.

**Greenwitch R&D**
The Beta Warchest holds the investment capital for businesses and dApps through Astar's dApp program.  Neurolanche and Nova Wallet hold a majority of the investments, at the moment, so we can capitalize on the investment yields that it produces, around $6/day at current prices.  Greenwitch R&D holds an option to the totality of the whole investment should it be determined the other 3rd party investments are out of scope the DAO business goals.

**Warchest Omega:**
Pros
- 17% APY
- $42,000 USD value
- Denomination: $DOT
- Yields 2.5 $DOT daily ($22/day)
- 0 day time-lock option available
Cons
- 28 day time-lock to liquidate, conventionally

Warchest Omega is the largest allocation of capital and the primary capital for full scale professional enterprise operations of the GreenwitchDAO, this includes full investment through derivatives trading, governance utility, and Polkadot core-time mercantile.  Current staking is through the Bifrost DAO which compounding derivative yields, earns about 2 $DOTs a day, requires 28 day time-lock to liquidate, 0 day time-lock option available for a fee.

The Omega Warchest is more than just the largest wealth repository of all our DAO treasury collective, it is the highest yielding and most flexible investment.  

This is Warchest example is the last resort for emergency capital.  All borrowing is over collateralized, and one can only borrow 1/3rd of the full value of the Omega Warchest, $42,000 total will allow no more than $13,860 at current prices.
