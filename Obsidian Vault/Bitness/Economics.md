The economy for most hackers is in the realm of DAO, because economic theory is a tool to implement strategies for the user and not for the centralized nation-state.

We mention old world economy and new world economy to understand the dynamics of both worlds of the centralized and decentralized systems at play.

Compounding Interest

# APR versus APY a practical guide
~dwulf

I felt the need to clarify this as it has gotten some confusion.
If you don't already, you need to understand the difference between APR and APY. Otherwise,
you will sound like a fool. If you have dealt with financial products (loans, credit cards, etc.)
even a little, then you will recognize APR and APY.
Return on investments are not expressed by months, weeks or days. By convention they are
expressed annually.
So when you say, "You can get 2% of APY/month", or "with a 1% interest/week", or "if you
compound interest on a 10% APY", then you sound like a fool.
There are two different acronyms you need to understand.
APR:
Annual percentage rate; it's the annual rate of return on an investment, without any
compounding.
It's basically the return you realize by lending (or staking, etc.) an asset after a year, if you do
not touch it (no compounding). So, if you invest $100'000 with a 10% APR, you will get a return
of $10,000 after a year (10%).
APY:
Annual percentage yield ; it's rate of return earned on an investment, taking into account the
effect of compounding interest.
It's the return you realize when compounding the interest whenever it's possible to do it. The
compounding can take place daily, weekly, monthly, annually. It depends on the terms &
conditions of your investment.
Compound interest:
It's the fact the interest accrued on your investment is (automatically/manually) added to your
investment and starts accruing interest as well.
An APR where you can compound interest daily is going to be a much higher APY than an APR
with monthly compounding.

Let's take a few examples:
12% APR. That's 12% per year (or 1% per month if you want). So if you invest $100, you get
12$ a year (1$ every month). After a year, you have $112.

12% APR allowing you to monthly compound. That's a 12.68% APY. So if you invest $100, you
get 1$ the first month (that you compound), $1.01 the next month, $1.021 the third, $1.0303 the fourth, and so on.

18% APY with a daily compound, is a 16.56% APR.  45% APY with monthly compound, is a 37.18% APR.

It is good to have a solid understanding of percentage rates and compounding. While the math
can seem a bit duplicit, it is there, and it is meaningful.
“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who
doesn't ... pays it.”
~Albert Einstein

I hope that helps some of you to better understand the financial aspects of your investments and use the correct terminology.
