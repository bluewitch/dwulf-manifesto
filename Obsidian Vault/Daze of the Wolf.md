Hereâ€™s a daily action plan tailored for your goal of increasing reach on X to onboard Polkadot developers and promote your independent production, "Daze of the Wolf":

  

Morning (8:00 AM - 11:00 AM PST)

- Content Creation:
    
    - Write a Thread: Begin the day by writing an engaging thread about one aspect of Polkadot or Substrate. Keep it informative yet entertaining, perhaps linking it to a recent development or a feature that would appeal to developers. Include calls-to-action (CTA) directing towards your show or for developer consultation inquiries.
