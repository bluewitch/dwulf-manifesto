# Web3 Foundation Zug
Experienced Polkadot Ambassador and Rust Developer Seeking to Impact the Future of Web3
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my profound interest in the Decentralized Technologies Developer
position for the Web3 Foundation Grants Program. With a solid background in Rust and
JavaScript, and an extensive, four-year involvement with the Polkadot ecosystem, I am ready to
utilize my skills, knowledge, and experience to push the boundaries of blockchain technologies.
My unique experiences as an ambassador for Polkadot and Astar have equipped me with a
deep understanding of blockchain technologies, their applications, and the challenges involved
in implementing them. Furthermore, my ambassadorial roles have honed my ability to manage
relationships with diverse external parties, which will be beneficial in liaising with applying teams
and other relevant teams within the foundation.
As a dedicated contributor to the open-source community, I have written a number of Medium
articles on Rust and Substrate, demonstrating my aptitude for comprehending complex
technologies and my ability to communicate these ideas effectively to a broad audience. I
believe these skills will be instrumental in evaluating grant applications, reviewing grantees'
deliverables, and aiding the overall improvement of the grants program.
While my passion for decentralization led me to become proficient in Docker and gain hands-on
experience with Linux and other Unix-based OSes, it is my technical ability to evaluate and test
software that I find most exciting about this role. My skills in setting up environments, compiling
complex projects and their dependencies, and evaluating automated test suites will be valuable
in assessing the technical merit of grant applications and deliverables.
My familiarity with the Substrate framework and the Polkadot ecosystem, combined with my
experience working with technical teams in the APAC region, position me uniquely to make
informed decisions in tandem with the Grants Committee. The knowledge gained from my years
of immersion in these technologies will aid in making impactful decisions, contributing to the
realization of the Web3 vision.
Working with the Web3 Foundation, especially in a role that directly impacts the future of Web3
technologies, is an opportunity I am extremely excited about. Whether I am based in Zug,
Switzerland or working remotely, I am committed to bringing my collaborative approach, clear
communication style, and technical expertise to your team.
Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss
how my experience and passion for blockchain technology can contribute to the success of the
Web3 Foundation Grants Program.
Best regards,
Douglas Kuhn
