Social Media is a term that, to me, means allow one to be known in the manner one wants to illustrate to the digital world.

Posting media, is how it works.  It is a art on one hand, to grab the attention of the viewer, dealing with a system of cinematography and story telling.  It is also a science, of numbers and the algorithms that show case a method to the madness of pure creation.

Both need to be in play, art and science, to do social media well
