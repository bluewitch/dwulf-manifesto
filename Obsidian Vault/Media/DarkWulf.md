I am the dark side of dwulf, some say evil, I say pragmatic.

That fool does not know half the power he has, but that is good, that is where I come in.

dwulf is not completely wrong, he just has a padded way of implementation and he is not a psychopath or sociopath.  He has a balanced mind and in many ways I envy him.

A mystery to be sure.

dwulf is more grey than I care to be, I am black, through and through, my objective is to hack the box and own it and if the user of the box pisses me off, I will burn them in unholy fyre.  But more often than not, I pass it to dwulf, he is good at negotiating business in the real world, much better than I.  He has his head in both worlds.

So he is fair, but very mercenary and business like.  His number one rule is to never negotiate without leverage.  Like when selling cyber security services, he and a few high end developers from the Philippines pen test and attempt to own their box, through a VPN somewhere in China.  He would schedule an appointment to sell cyber security services, but didn't care if he got the contract or not, it was simply a recon deployment for him.

If he got the contract, good, he got a pipeline of revenue from a client, if he did not get the contract, he would simply monetize his recon data and sell it on the market, to select data-brokers.  One way or another, gold finds its way to the Iron Bank.

The diffrence between dwulf and myself, is dwulf is detatched and adapts, I am attached and it is hard for me to change.  I have allot to learn from him, how he can be such a cool and calm guy, when the maul of chaos is about to devour him.

But as if the will of god himself, can weather any storm.  That courage, fearlessness, and level headness.  Qualities I only wish I had.

I asked him how he does it, his answer was always the same.
"face the storm, embrace its ire 
although its wrath is great.
I border madness, with desire,
the weavers know my fate.
My craft is known, and tested,
compiles memories true.
The only way I'm bested,
is to forget what I knew.
Pain and death, may take my breath,
my last words will be spoken.
before my body falls in depth,
my soul would be awoken."
