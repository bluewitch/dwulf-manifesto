Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transvestite

This section is p0rn for all practical purposes.  Carefully cultivated, curated, and pruned.  In my world male is male XY, female is female XX, but the respective mental gender is allegedly malleable.  Gender has no physical meaning to physical sex since role-play and awkward social sexual encounters are the best one can pretend to be.

As a past surgeon, I know there is no real sex change operation, that can actually transform biological sex, the sex change surgery is more like mutilation of the naughty bits.  Just genital mutilation, you can play sex as much as you want, but in the end you will not be what your imagination conjurers. 

# The X chart

The X chart, gauges the degree and spectrum of the erotic.  This is important as it will often be a determining factor of whether to censor "art" or display "porn".  Usually it is about nuance and subtle displays of human body parts.

In all cases is anything X is ipso facto NSFW (Not Safe For Work), even with simple erotic like images, it is wise to determine the social equilibrium, depictions of scantly clad women (or men), even with the naughty bits hidden a image could trigger anyone.

# p0rn

So a p0rn collection category, in almost all of its variations holds a certain social
discrimination that can include anything between social shaming to full on incarceration and your name on a list for being a sexual deviant for life in any event and even after time has been served. Because of this, I have created p0rn categories that include various levels of erotic spectrum that includes Female, Lesbians, Fetish/Gay, and Fetish/WTF, rated

- X(erotica)
- XX(carnal)
- XXX(kinky)
- XXXX(WTF?) respectively.

It is difficult to gauge where most average people mark the difference from one category to the next, and it is super important where the rule of law distinguishes these arbitrary cut off points, but I try to measure it based on my best guess.

**X(erotica)**
![[lez_erotic.jpg]]
This level is made to grade the lightest level of “sexual deviation”, that will slide into more progressively appropriate fetish categories.
X, erotica is the most benign and basic, and for the most part may be considered “art”, that illustrates everything from seductively
dressed to semi nude, covering the tits and the naughty bits and sometimes (rarely) totally nude women with nipples and privates partially covered, very little (if any) actual intercourse, certainly no gross spewing or ejaculation of bodily fluids, cum fiestas or other bodily fluids all over the place.  Think more along the lines of "soft porn", hugging, hand holding, a gentle kiss, and mostly fore-play.  

Erotica may not be suitable for public display and as a rule of thumb, would generally still considered NSFW not safe for work, but some X(erotica) might be tolerated with more mature and tolerable audiences, but take no chances with corporate co-ed or HR heavy work places.

**XX(carnal)**
![](bum_carnal_1281746390287.jpg)
XX, the next level is carnal, wardrobe malfunctions be dammed, all clothes are off or at least the clothes that cover the naughty bits, total and complete nudes butt naked, clear genital exposure, and normal conventional intercourse are common place.  XX includes girl on girl and lesbian action, rubbing each other's quim, but _excludes_ guy on guy and gay men and guy on guy anal sex, which is considered more riska and is in the XXX level.

The only reason for this is arbitrary, as a rule, and rigidly defined line is that women with
women are seemingly more socially acceptable and aesthetically pleasing to the eye than men with men (something about a dick
makes it dangerous and bears more social discrimination).

**XXX(kinky)**
![](ks_dildotraining_0.png)
XXX, at kinky levels, gay male sex may enter the picture as it strays into fetish territory, more graphic and unconventional sex, latex, tranny and transvestite, she-males, gay sex, femdom, cross-dressing, women dominating men, and sex toys are the norm.

This XXX level can be seen as perversion by more conservative onlookers, and a typical Tuesday night for the LGBT+ crowd,  XXX can be a bit more socially awkward since it pushes more into fetishes and a fetish can be anything, in this category and different people have different tolerances for fetishes. Mostly harmless up to light taboos, incest role plays of mother son, brother sister, teacher student, naughty nurse, nasty secretary etc.

Being XXX kinky can get into some unconventionally strange territory in and out of bed.

**XXXX(WTF?)**
![]()
XXXX WTF, is the official **What The Fuck** category, and because of its extreme nature
is always completely drawn out, or rendered and considered artistic porn.   Quite frankly this is the 4chan territory other category anything goes a world of smut from which there is no return.  Takes kinky to a whole new level from the extremely weird sex with anatomical oddities, including tentacles, animal penis, to the extremely gross (two girls, one cup) and other shitty experiences, to the very horrific (extreme pain Olympics castration, mutilation). Not for the faint of heart...you have been warned.

All acts portrayed, even if they are fully illustrated well, or rendered picture like quality, could border on serious real world complications with legal systems.  This is especially true if actual studios where involved that produced photos or films were actually produced from real people as opposed to life like, deepfake avatars. 

XXXX can consist of beyond strange fetish oddities like mutated bodies with multiple breasts and penis appendages, demon rapes, scat (sexual acts involving fecal material), golden showers (sexual acts involving urination), castration mutilation and other way out things. A full XXXX.

It is important to note that nothing in the XXXX category is real and all images or video have been altered and/or completely fabricated and is filtered accordingly.
