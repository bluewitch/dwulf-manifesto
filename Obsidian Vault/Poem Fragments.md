## Tarot
Show the scary Tarot cards,
or throw them to the wind.

Your fate is tied to the song of bards,
and to every mortal sin.

Both high and low arcana magick,
will weave your tale of fate.
how love could be so tradgic,
and the truth cannot relate.

The cards they have no meaning,
once they tell their story.
from a vision you are weaning,
a hint of fortune and glory.

You still must know your craft,
your tools sharpened and oiled.
