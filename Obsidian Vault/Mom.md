Mother's Day in May, without you.
~dwulf

As I sit here alone on this day of mother's day,  
I can feel you guiding me from above,  
Reminding me that even though you are gone away,  
You will always be with us in our hearts we love.

Your memory still haunts my mind,  
As I try to move forward and find the light,  
Knowing that without your support and guidance,  
I would never have been able to fight.

But even though you are gone from this world,  
You will always remain in our hearts forevermore,  
And we will continue to cherish all that was yours,  
As a mother and as a wife who loved us so dearly.

So on this day of Mother's Day, I wish you could be here again,  
To celebrate with us in the way you always did before.  
But instead, let me honour your memory by living my life to its fullest,  
And striving to be the person that you knew I could become.
