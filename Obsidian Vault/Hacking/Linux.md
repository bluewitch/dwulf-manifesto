Born from the fires of the ancient C patched code of UNIX, Linux, betrothed to the free Linux community, for those who listen to her secrets if you will understand and know her, you can gleam a kernel of her truth, and with that power...become god.

- Ubuntu (Debian), Main Driver
- NixOS, 
- BlackArch
- Kali Linux
- [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/)

Not to get into any religious wars of which version is better I selected these on their functions rather than street cred.

Ubuntu, derived from Debian has made the cut for me.  It is not the best, I still haven't fully adopted to snap packages, mostly `apt` commands.

NixOS, had some graphical issues on the initial install on my Lenovo Legion, so decided to keep this as a Docker image, to run as a server

Kali Linux and BlackArch, The weapon of choice for penetration to networks.   Kali Linux to do the actual job, and BlackArch for bragging rights and say, "BTW I use Arch"
