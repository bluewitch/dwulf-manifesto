# The Professional Hacker Manifesto: 
### Empowering Decentralization through Hardware, Software, Blockchain, and AI


Introduction:  
When I first set out to write this manifesto, the  rapidly changing world made it almost impossible to put quill to parchment, and create a permanent and finalized manifesto book.  So I opted to create a github that would protect the integrity of the conventional "book" format with the dynamic updating repository that git can allow for.

The role of hackers has evolved beyond simply exploiting vulnerabilities and hacking for the lulz, most adults need to make a living and earn a wage. My goal with this manifesto is to forge methods to be a well paid, professional hacker, one with expertise and specialization to negotiate with. 

We, hackers, recognize the potential of technology to empower decentralization and disrupt existing power structures. This manifesto outlines my personal commitment to developing skills in knowing the engineering behind hardware, embedded and microcontroller systems, the software systems that are installed on the hardware systems (specifically the Operating Systems, drivers, etc.), blockchain technologies that provide a whole banking system and a personal wallet, and symbiotic A.I. agents, to help the user create a more equitable and resilient digital landscape of this brave new world.

# Separated into 4 pillars

**Pillar 1: Engineering Hardware Gear (EHG)**

- Develop expertise in hardware hacking, including circuit board analysis, reverse engineering, and IoT device manipulation with the understanding of WiFi, Bluetooth and other spectrum to and from the base board.
- Understand the inner workings and the binary math of computing systems, including CPU architectures, memory hierarchy, and input/output operations.
- Familiarize yourself with various programming languages for microcontrollers and single-board computers (e.g., C, C++, Rust, and Python).

**Pillar 2: Full Competence with Software Systems (FCSS)**

- Master operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and network protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP).
- Develop proficiency in software development environments (IDEs, text editors), including BASH scripting, Python, and Rust.
- Understand the fundamentals of programming languages (C, C++, Java, etc.) and their applications.

**Pillar 3: Blockchain Systems (BBS) aka The Wallet**

If you follow no other rule, follow this one:
- **Create a corner-stone hardware wallet, off-line, air-gapped, and enshrined in metal.**

- Delve into the principles of blockchain technology, including decentralization, distributed ledgers, and EVM and Ink! smart contracts.
- Develop expertise in Polkadot Substrate framework, and Ethereum's EVM Solidity in equal measure, but also study compare, contrast and clarify the other blockchain frameworks, Solana, Cosmos, Binance, etc., focusing on their implementation, scalability, and interoperability.
- Understand the regulatory mechanics of cryptocurrencies, from the initial funding of initial coin offerings (ICOs), and the mechanics of coordination of decentralized finance (DeFi) systems.  Learn how to properly navigate the regulatory frameworks when and if you need to surface into the real old world economy. 

**Pillar 4: Artificial Intelligence Agents (AIAA)**
This is the holy grail of the manifesto, an A.I. agent is ment to be your muse, that is your co-pilot, that will eventually become your pilot.  

The A.I. agent is programmed for you, and has your best interest in mind.  In all things, your health, your well being, your wealth, everything and anything that inherits a net positive for you.

The perfect agent would filter correspondence that would bring negative concatenation to its pair-bonded user, this includes both straight up illegal scams (a scammer calls from "your bank", scam virus support, etc.) to actual legal but unscrupulous (cold calling, gold for cash, payday loans, bill collectors, etc.) 

- Learn about the concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing LLMs.  You must know the mind of the machine.
- Develop skills in creating AI agents to support DAO operations, such as predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, and decision-making systems.  Start small, with open-sourced options like llama and adopt more specialized data-sets.
- Understand the potential risks associated with AI and ML, including data privacy concerns and algorithmic biases or hallucinations.  I see this as creating an immortal goddess of truth and love, prime the A.I. for good and truth, at the very least that will inoculate for bad data-sets for evil and lies.

Conclusion: 
All Professional hackers, must know these 4 pillars, preferably in equal measure, to be effective in their trade.  All professionals should commit to leveraging their skills in engineering hardware gear, devices are extensions to their physical capabilities when hacking, for example drones can receive wifi and bluetooth and be mobile to different signals  full competence with software systems, Python and Rust, are good to establish strong foundations to your system and also blockchain (i.e., Money) systems, a hacker's straight up digital DeFi bank, and a hacker's stash wallet, and finally artificial intelligence agents to drive automation and decentralization and promote a more equitable digital landscape. By empowering all these technologies, a savvy hacker can disrupt existing power structures, foster innovation, and create a more resilient future for all.
