The dwulf Manifesto has honour and ethical guidelines as well as the technical breakdown of how to hack and how to set up your space and your command center.

We are ronin, make no mistake, dishonored samurai by a patrons unreasonable rules, like lets get real I am not committing suicide because my boss is butt hurt.

But some of the ethical guidelines can carry over.

Bushido code of conduct is as follows:

### Righteousness (義 gi).

Justice is the most important virtue for the samurai and people in general. A true samurai does not attack the enemy without an important reason and without full mindfulness of probable consequences.

### Loyalty (忠義 chūgi).

Loyalty is the 2nd most important thing in life. The samurai should always be loyal to his master. The samurai should also believe his duty to protect his master is the meaning of life.

### Honour (名誉 meiyo).

A life without honour is not a life. If a samurai makes a mistake, he should honor his name by committing suicide. (Example: The story of 47 samurai (the Ako Incident).

### Respect (礼 rei).

A samurai should always respect his enemy. A samurai respects his opponent before and after the fight. Even if a samurai kills his opponent, he is very respectful to the corpse.

Honesty ( 誠 sei).

A samurai never lies. “Deception” does not exists in the book of a samurai.

Courage (勇 yū).

A samurai fights until the end. A samurai is never afraid of anything. He is not afraid of death. A samurai is always brave because he fights for something he believes in.

Consistency (誠 makoto ).

A samurai never changes the path. He is like a dragonfly, he always moves forward, he never moves back.
