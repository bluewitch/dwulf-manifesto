Hardening a system is mostly a consolidation and accountancy of all applications on your system.

We honestly start with the Operating System core, and then lay the applications upon it that harden the system network itself, encryption PGP (for emails), VPN/SSH (for network), Bind9 (for DNS) and are developer specific, Rust compilers and Python interpreters, Browsers Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc.  A proper IDE, VSCode/Codium.  Also applications that engineer software, Git, Docker, K8, prometheus and grafana.

- Virgin OS (Debian, etc.)
- Network Build Protocol (VPN, SSH, Bind9)
- Development Build Protocol
	- Software Engineering (VSCodium, Rust, Python Mojo)
	- Engineering Software (Git, Docker, K8) 


# Passwords

user:
root:
su root:

user
has permission scope to common applications and required dApps, levels of control that require or infiltrate upon any device core function, like network systems, will usually be prompted to supply a root password, sometimes called an administration password to escalate permissions 

root
has permission scope of user plus /bin, which are typically core to the operations of users in relation to fundamental operations like network and firewalls 

su root:
has permission scope for user plus /bin plus /sbin (everything), mostly in Linux systems another level of super root user can effect all levels of the Operating System including protected process threads that are not in the user space what so ever and should not be trifled with.
