    
The famous 3 2 1 rule basically says it all;

- Make 3 copies of your files
    
- Use at least 2 different locations / media
    
- Bring at least 1 copy 'remote'
    

I just incorporated my Obsidian backups into my general backup system, which is for me:

- Obsidian files live in their own folder on my harddrive, not inside Google Drive or any other cloud provider
    
- I create an encrypted ZIP file each week, this one is stored in Google Drive (and therefore also synced to the cloud)
    
- Once a month I sync my whole Google Drive folder to an external harddisk which is normally not attached to any computer. --_note, I do 'sync', but I keep close tabs on files being overwritten or deleted_
    
- Also once a month I make an encrypted ZIP of everything in my Google Drive and upload that to Amazon Glacier for long time storage
    

For Obsidian files that means:

- I can use the Obsidian Sync version history to restore older versions or 'undelete' a file
    
- I can use my local ZIP files to go back week by week
    
- I can use my Amazon Glacier store to go back month by month
    

You don't really need such an elaborate system, it's just mine. If you are only worried about your Obsidian files I would complement your files already being in Google Drive with 2 extra actions:

1. Make a ZIP of your whole vault folder periodically (put it on your calendar if you forget it otherwise), this makes sure if things really go wrong, you can at least go back to the previous period
    
2. Your Obsidian folder should already be "offline available", if you store the ZIPs mentioned above in Google Drive as well, make that folder also "offline available", so in case you have no access to your Google Drive, the files are still there
    

**BONUS TIP:** Consider making backups of other important files, even an external disk where you put stuff on you don't want to lose makes a huge difference if your main computer breaks down
