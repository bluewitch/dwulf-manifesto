The purpose of a home lab, is to have a clear understanding of the technicalities of computer engineering.
In my writings I have 2 areas of dicipline

Software Engineering, that entails the actual scripting and programming languages and how to write the actual code, layering the variables and the functions to perform the tasks we need.  At its roots of first principles, and a strong command of architecture algorithms Software Engineering is what a coder is.  Myself I have made the hero's journey from a hacker to a professional engineer, a maverick inbetween an unlisted man and a officer to high priest.


Engineering Software, is the DevOps orchestration, the supporting cast, of the software you actually write.  Github "git" CI/CD, Terra Form, Ansible, Docker, K8, Prometheus and Graphana, DataDog.

Interestingly, DevOps and the engineering of the software that has been coded and developed is more in demand than the Software Engineering itself.  It is implied that a DevOps knows Software Engineering as a matter of course to orchestrate it correctly.  It is assumed one knows how to code or at least script and configure their environment already.

A homelab, is a testament to this skill-set, it demonstrates your capability personally to demonstrate it professionally.  It is quite similar to business and enterprise level operations, the exact same engineering techniques are used on a homelab that are on a higher level system of business, they just use more expensive and more capable hardware systems.
