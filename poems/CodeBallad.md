# CodeBallad
### ~dwulf

It started with a C, and then a plus plus more,  
I had to think in pointers as my brains fell on the floor.

Then a bit of magic in a browser on the web,  
I started to learn ECMA Script with JavaScript instead.

But not all the browsers played together, and not all the scope was solid.  
With bugs and with half-hacked code,  
I sung another ballad.

The code it was so simple, and very object based.  
With Jupyter and pip installed, it was more like cut and paste.

Python was the hidden treasure right before my eyes,  
and I didn't even see it, until I realized.

A logic in a function, a parameter set to pass,  
and if you don't return it, then you can kiss my ass.

Syntax counts in large amounts, as do the character places.  
and logic objects take account, no matter tabs or spaces.

Python let me play the field,  
with all the cross compilers.

Java, C and JavaScript, to put out all my fires.

And so I come full circle, from here to there, again  
A function is a function, the same packet you will send.

Slice the strings and all such things, to formalize your query.  
In the case of database, you'll see your data clearly.

Once you know your principles, your code will parse corrected,  
lint your lines and you'll be fine, no bug will be neglected.

And when the A.I. agents come to take your place,  
they'll complete your every sentence and occupy your space.

The robots will outlive us, immortal to the end,  
A quantum soul transcends us, a system it will send.

A bit a byte a binary slight, no error in your system,  
No line of code is left untried, as to perfection, we lift 'em.

In the universe of algorithms, in the world of nanoseconds,  
A coder finds their rhythm, in binary connections.

Syntax, logic, form, and function, in every line, we parse,  
In each problem's reduction, we find our universe's sparse.

With every function that we fold, with each recursive call,  
A new universe we unfold, a new reality befall.

When silicon meets intelligence, when logic meets the byte,  
A world beyond our cognizance, in code, we find our light.

In circuits and in memory chips, in data flowing free,  
We find life's hidden scripts, in a CodeBallad's decree.

A human touch in every line, a thought in every loop,  
CodeBallad's sweet, intricate design, in every coding group.

In the end, the code will sing, a ballad soft and bright,  
And in this digital echoing, we'll find our coder's light.

The AI might outlive us, yet our mark remains clear,  
In every bit and byte, our essence will appear.

So, we code, and we build, and we debug each line,  
Creating worlds, bit by bit, in the realm of space and time.

For the coder's heart is eternal, immortal in its way,  
In each line, each terminal, in the CodeBallad, we sway.
