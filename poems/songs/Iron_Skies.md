# **Epic Voyage Through Iron Skies**

---

**Intro**  
_Whispered winds paired with a slow-building instrumental, setting an adventurous tone._

---

### **Verse 1**  
Beneath the watchful gaze of **Satellite 15**,  
Beyond the Final Frontier, where few have ever been.  
I journeyed far, to the golden land,  
Chasing legends, with a map in hand.

---

### **Chorus**  
**El Dorado**, city of dreams so bright,  
Lost in time, hidden from the world's sight.  
But it's not the gold, nor treasures that I seek,  
It's the tales untold, and the secrets they keep.

---

### **Verse 2**  
In the heart of the jungle, the **Mother of Mercy** waits,  
Guiding lost souls, deciding their fates.  
But I press on, the fire in my soul still burns,  
For **Coming Home**, is what my heart yearns.

---

### **Bridge**  
But first, I meet **The Alchemist**, old and wise,  
Whispers of spells, and magic in his eyes.  
He speaks of the **Isle of Avalon**, a place so serene,  
Where time stands still, and the air is so clean.

---

### **Chorus**  
But I'm **Starblind**, lost in the cosmic glow,  
Chasing shadows, wherever they go.  
With **The Talisman** in hand, I find my way,  
Its power guides me, come night or day.

---

### **Verse 3**  
In a distant realm, I met **The Man Who Would Be King**,  
His tales of bravery, made the night sing.  
He spoke of battles, of honor, of pride,  
Of legends and myths, from the world outside.

---

**Instrumental Break**  
_Electric guitars wail, drums roll, a vivid representation of the adventure and challenges faced._

---

### **Verse 4**  
As the journey nears its end, and the horizon shows,  
I brace myself, **When the Wild Wind Blows**.  
The storm rages on, but my spirit never breaks,  
For I've seen wonders, with every step I take.

---

### **Outro**  
Now as I stand, on the edge of time,  
I recount my voyage, through rhythm and rhyme.  
From the stars above, to the earth below,  
This epic journey, forever it will glow.

_The song fades out with a gentle guitar strumming, reminiscent of a weary traveler finding peace._
