# Legacy of the 64

## Verse 1:
In the age of neon lights and arcade's roar,  
Emerged a legend, the Commodore 64.  
With 64 kilobytes, it ruled the scene,  
A digital knight, in armor of green.

## Verse 2:
The keys clacked with rhythm, the tape drive did whir,  
Gamers and coders, their passions did stir.  
From BASIC commands, to sprites on the screen,  
It wove magic realms, the likes never seen.

## Chorus:
Oh, Commodore! Legacy of the byte,  
Guiding us through the digital night.  
With every load, with every play,  
You paved the way, in the silicon fray.

## Verse 3:
Sid chip was humming, melodies so grand,  
Epic adventures unfolded, in pixelated land.  
From "Ghostbusters" cries, to "Space Invader" flights,  
The 64's realm was full of delights.

## Verse 4:
Hackers found solace, in its simple design,  
Crafting their worlds, line by coding line.  
On screens of cathode ray, in hues of blue and gray,  
The future was being shaped, day by day.

## Chorus:
Oh, Commodore! Pioneer of the code,  
On binary highways, you set the mode.  
In a world of Atari, and Spectrum's glow,  
The 64's legacy would forever grow.

## Bridge:
It wasnâ€™t just hardware, but dreams cast in plastic,  
A portal to worlds, both mystic and fantastic.  
With joystick in hand, and floppy to load,  
We embarked on quests, down memory road.

## Verse 5:
Yet, as years flowed, newer tech took the stage,  
The 64's reign seemed locked in a bygone age.  
But in hearts of those, who heard its chime,  
The Commodore's echo transcends all of time.

## Chorus:
Oh, Commodore! In history's core,  
You're not just a machine, but so much more.  
In circuits and chips, your legend we store,  
Hail to thee, our beloved 64.

## Outro:
And now as we stand, in this digital tide,  
With devices aplenty, by our side.  
Still, in the quiet, a whisper we hear,  
Of the Commodore 64, a legend so dear.
