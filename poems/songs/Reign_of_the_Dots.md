### **Verse 1**
In a world once bound by chains, where freedom seemed so rare,  
Echoed cries of the silenced, rising through the air.  
From the depths of obscurity, Polkadot took its stance,  
With Astar by its side, they began their cryptic dance.  

---

### **Pre-Chorus**
Ancient systems crumbled, as the old guards watched in fear,  
A new dawn was approaching, the revolution was near.  
For the age of crypto anarchy, was now set to unfold,  
Shattering the barriers, the tales of freedom told.  

---

### **Chorus**
🌍 Rise, rise, the Reign of the Dots is here,  
Destroying the old, as the new frontier draws near.  
Code becomes law, on the blocks they lay,  
A world rebuilt, in the crypto way. 🌍  

---

### **Verse 2**
Obsolete regulations, lost in the sands of time,  
For a new world was forming, with every single line.  
Astar's brilliance shined, paving roads never seen,  
Crafting a universe, where all would be serene.  

---

### **Bridge**
No more the puppet strings, no more the shadowed halls,  
The chains of the past break, as the new era calls.  
Solid engineering, the core of this new land,  
Where transparency reigns, and together we stand.  

---

### **Chorus**
🌍 Rise, rise, the Reign of the Dots is here,  
Destroying the old, as the new frontier draws near.  
Code becomes law, on the blocks they lay,  
A world rebuilt, in the crypto way. 🌍  

---

### **Verse 3**
The silenced voices now heard, in this decentralized realm,  
With every transaction, a new captain at the helm.  
The legacy of Polkadot, and Astar’s radiant glow,  
Guided the masses, as the seeds of change did grow.  

---

### **Outro**
So here we stand, on the cusp of a new day,  
The old world behind, as we light the way.  
For in the Reign of the Dots, with every passing block,  
We find our freedom, and together, we rock.  

---

### **Chorus**
🌍 Rise, rise, the Reign of the Dots is here,  
Destroying the old, as the new frontier draws near.  
Code becomes law, on the blocks they lay,  
A world rebuilt, in the crypto way. 🌍
