  # Fading Code: A Hacker's Descent

---

**Intro:**  
_Thunderous drums, a lone guitar wails in the distance, echoing the chaos that's about to unfold._

---

### Verse 1:
In a city sprawling, neon lights glowing dim,  
An engineer walked, a simple life, a dream.  
But in a twist of binary, in a shadow cast,  
He was branded a menace, a hacker of the past.

---

### Verse 2:
Tales of breaches, of systems torn asunder,  
His name was whispered, with awe and with thunder.  
Yet innocence lay in his heart, unyielding, true,  
A pawn in a game, where the players were few.

---

### Chorus:
Falling, spiraling, into the abyss so deep,  
A man with no crime, a secret he'd keep.  
In the heart of the city, where codes intertwine,  
The engineer's fate, in neon lights would shine.

---

### Verse 3:
He walked the streets, a target on his back,  
Chased by agents, in suits of black.  
The city, it watched, its gaze cold and unfeeling,  
The hacker's journey, a wound, never healing.

---

### Bridge:
Digital whispers, in alleys, they spoke,  
Of a man falsely accused, a life up in smoke.  
With every step, every shadow he'd pass,  
He fought against a fate, as fragile as glass.

---

### Verse 4:
In the heart of downtown, screens ablaze,  
He sought refuge, in the digital maze.  
Binary sequences, his shield and his sword,  
Against an empire, where truth was ignored.

---

### Chorus:
Descending, unravelling, a system's cruel jest,  
A hero unnamed, put to the ultimate test.  
Amidst chaos and code, in circuits he'd confide,  
Seeking justice, with truth by his side.

---

**Instrumental Break:**  
_Dark, heavy riffs plunge the listener deeper into the tumultuous journey, reflecting the protagonist's struggle._

---

### Verse 5:
In the glowing horizon, a server tower stood tall,  
The engineer's destination, his final protocol.  
To clear his name, to rewrite his tale,  
Against cyber tycoons, he vowed not to fail.

---

### Bridge:
Silent battles, in lines of code were waged,  
In the digital arena, a war of ages raged.  
Bit by bit, he dismantled their lies,  
Revealing the truth, under cybernetic skies.

---

### Verse 6:
As dawn broke, the city awoke from its trance,  
The engineer's legacy, given a second chance.  
From a falsely accused hacker, a legend did spawn,  
In the light of a new day, justice would dawn.

---

### Outro:
In circuits and wires, his story would be told,  
Of a hero in bytes, brave and bold.  
In the annals of cyberspace, his tale would resound,  
The engineer who stood tall, when the world came falling down.

---

_In a world defined by zeroes and ones, truth remains the ultimate key. Against all odds, the spirit of justice prevails._
