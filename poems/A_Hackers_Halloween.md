# Daemon's Prize: A Hacker's Halloween

In the depths of night, on Halloween's eve,
A hacker, bold and daring, you best believe,
With keystrokes swift and fingers deft,
Set out to code a daemon, his greatest theft.

Beneath the moon's pale, eerie glow,
He typed in shadows, a spectral show,
Lines of code danced on the screen,
As he wove a web of code, unseen.

The daemon arose from lines of script,
In the world of cyberspace, it slipped,
A creature born of ones and zeros,
With powers that would send shivers.

The clock ticked towards the witching hour,
As the hacker harnessed dark cyberpower,
He sought a prize beyond compare,
A hack so grand, it would make him rare.

With the daemon by his virtual side,
He hacked through firewalls, undenied,
Into systems locked with secrets deep,
Where digital treasures lay asleep.

The witching hour arrived, the world asleep,
But the hacker's vigil, he vowed to keep,
In cyberspace, he cast his spell,
To breach the fortress, where secrets dwell.

He found the prize, a digital chest,
A treasure trove, a hacker's quest,
With a grin, he whispered to the night,
"I've claimed the prize of this eerie flight."

But as the clock struck midnight's chime,
A whisper echoed through cyberspace's rhyme,
The daemon he'd summoned, with darkness cloaked,
Whispered secrets only the shadows spoke.

The hacker's prize, a double-edged blade,
For power gained came with a price paid,
In the world of bits, where shadows dwell,
He'd unlocked secrets, too dark to tell.

As dawn approached, the hacker knew,
The daemon's gift had a haunting hue,
He'd ventured deep where secrets lied,
And paid a price he couldn't hide.

So, beware, all hackers who dare,
To summon daemons to claim and share,
For in the witching hour's eerie black,
The line between power and darkness is slack.

In the realm of code and digital might,
The hacker learned that on that night,
The prize of the witching hour's hack,
Could lead to shadows, both deep and black.
