  ## Code is the Law - An Epic Tale

_Code is the Law_, founded on Binary,
<br>Compile it all, leave none to be wary.
<br>In realms of zeros and ones, we play,
<br>Creating worlds, in lines of array.

In the dawn of machines, with gears and steam,
<br>We dreamt a dream, a silicon dream.
<br>Of electric minds, in metal encased,
<br>And so began, this relentless chase.

_Code is the Law_, In circuits we trust,
<br>Crafting algorithms from silicon dust.
<br>An epic of logic, functions and loops,
<br>In the saga of systems, where data regroups.

From the mighty mainframes, stern and tall,
<br>To the humble microchips, minuscule and small.
<br>Every node, every gate, every transistor's call,
<br>Echoes one truth - _Code is the Law_.

Through ethernet jungles, and server domain,
<br>Through bytes and bits, in the silicon rain.
<br>In each instruction, in every protocol,
<br>Resides our decree - _Code is the Law_.

When dawn breaks over the silicon vale,
<br>New lines of code set sail.
<br>Inventing, refining, without a pause,
<br>In this realm, you see, _Code is the Law_.

And as the sun sets, LEDs glow bright,
<br>Coders conjure magic in the night.
<br>In the dance of keys, they find no flaw,
<br>In the rhythm of code, as _Code is the Law_.

Thus spins our tale, an epic true,
<br>Of battles fought, in shades of blue.
<br>Remember, always, without a gnaw,
<br>In this digital epoch - _Code is the Law_.
