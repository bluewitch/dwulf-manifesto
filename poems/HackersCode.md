The Hackers' Code - Revised
~dwulf

In the dawn, my hat was white,
Guiding me through day and night.
But lines blurred, the Feds did shout,
Twisting truth, casting doubt.

My hat then turned a darker shade,
In the battlefield, where games were played.
But the cost of knowledge, quite exact,
Without a college, facts lacked.

Next, I donned the hat of grey,
As business spoke in cryptic way.
To pierce the veil, the hidden trend,
In this complex world, to comprehend.

Now, I've traced the circle round,
From inception to the sound,
Of my own logic, crisp and true,
In every message that I spew.

In balance I stand, firm and bold,
While weaker hands their cards do fold.
My codefoo strikes, with law its sword,
In the vast web where code's the lord.
