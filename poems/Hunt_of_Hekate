# The Hunt of Hekate
_by dwulf_

> We summoned magicks we could not wield,  
> digital metrics, a firewall shield.  

- The poem opens with the speaker admitting that they have brought about forces (digital technology, symbolized as magic) that they couldn't fully control, signifying the unanticipated complexity and power of the digital world.

> These monitors fill our eyes with light,  
> and 24 hours of second sight.  

- The speaker alludes to the omnipresence of technology in our lives and its capacity to reveal things beyond immediate physical reality ("second sight"). This may also refer to the information overexposure that technology brings.

> Our souls are drawn to this infernal machine,  
> We behold the sights no mortal has seen.  

- The stanza hints at the almost addictive allure of technology and the unique experiences and knowledge it provides, beyond what was possible in the pre-digital era.

> The world raises an army to stop us on our path,  
> Fire meets Ice, chaos and meets wrath.  

- The speaker introduces a conflict, possibly against those who misuse technology or against authorities trying to regulate or control the digital sphere. The stanza alludes to the struggles between opposing forces in the cyber realm.

> They are coming to hunt us, to take what they have given,  
> Their shadows we do see, to know them we our driven.  

- This stanza continues the conflict theme, with the 'hunt' perhaps signifying the legal or societal forces trying to curtail the hackers. The 'shadows' might represent traces or digital footprints of these forces, which the hackers seek to understand.

> Bit by Bit, and Byte by Byte,   
> We have their digits within our sight.  

- The speaker describes the painstaking and methodical process of hacking, represented by the gradual accumulation of data (bit by bit, byte by byte).

> Index their data and imperfect places,  
> Tracking their movements to decimal places.  

- Here, the speaker talks about exploiting weaknesses in data security and tracking the activities of their opponents to precise levels, using the metaphor of 'decimal places' to emphasize this.

> Ports open or closed and nmap will know,  
> footholds in quantum and fingerprints show.  

- This stanza refers to using tools like nmap for network exploration or security auditing. 'Footholds in quantum' might be symbolic of advanced quantum computing techniques. The speaker is establishing their mastery over sophisticated technology.

> Count technical knowhow and raise it by skill,  
> routers will now bow, code bends to our will.  

- The speaker emphasizes the importance of both technical knowledge and skill, suggesting that with these, they can control networks and manipulate code at will.

> You live within data, but information is ours,  
> With bits that now showcase your moon and your stars.  

- This stanza illustrates the control and ownership the speaker asserts over information, suggesting that while others live 'within' data, the hackers have the power to interpret, manipulate, and own the information.

> If you seek to find us, and bind us to law,  
> you must unwind us, and beckon our call.  

- The speaker dares their opponents to find them and bring them to justice, implying that it would require understanding their complexities and perhaps even 'speaking their language'.

> We fear no writ of mere mortal law,  
> No bullets or bombs, that make nations fall.  

- This stanza asserts the speaker's fearlessness before the law and physical violence. They suggest that in the digital realm, conventional power structures and threats are irrelevant.

> We are not subject to realms of the flesh,  
> A Terminal console, and IoT mesh.  

- The speaker states that they exist primarily in the digital world, not the physical one. They perceive their reality through interfaces like terminal consoles and IoT (Internet of Things) networks.

> You live within laws, that never evolve,  
> Computational math with no problems to solve.  

- The speaker contrasts the static, unchanging nature of traditional laws with the dynamic, problem-solving nature of computational mathematics. The latter may symbolize the ever-evolving nature of technology and the hacker ethos.

> We weave our patterns with functional thread,  
> Code is the law, the command has been said.  

- The speaker introduces a metaphor of weaving patterns (writing code), with the 'functional thread' perhaps indicating functional programming. 'Code is the law' may suggest that in their world, the rules are made by those who can manipulate code.

> Our power is function, a task that is set,  
> Your folly? assumption, of POST over GET.  

- The speaker highlights their power derived from the function or utility of their code and tasks they perform. They mock their opponents' naivety, symbolized by the assumption of using POST over GET - an elementary mistake in web development.

> Your eyes are now taken with image and sound,  
> forgotten are pathways that lay on the ground.  

- The stanza laments the loss of connection with reality due to an over-reliance on digital stimulation. 'Pathways that lay on the ground' may symbolize traditional ways of understanding and interacting with the world.

> Our glamour bedazzles with pleasure and bliss,  
> A script that seduces your last flatline kiss.  

- The speaker talks about the allure of the digital realm, but also hints at its potential dangers, using the metaphor of a 'flatline kiss' to suggest a lethal attraction.

> Be wary and careful, the moves that you make,  
> and always remember these moves we will take.  

- The speaker issues a warning about the potential consequences of actions in the digital realm, reminding the reader that these 'moves' can be tracked and used.

> Now the prize becomes clear, just shift the digits,  
> We'll leave you to wallow through software and widgets.  

- This stanza might suggest that the true 'prize' lies not in tangible rewards, but in understanding and mastering the digital world. The speaker dismisses the superficial aspects of technology ('software and widgets').

> When the code becomes clear, the message will too,  
> Just parse the strings from the old to the new.  

- The speaker hints at a hidden message or deeper understanding that can be gained by interpreting 'the code' or deciphering the workings of the digital world.

> The hunt will be over, its prize will avoid,  
> The one does not see it, cast back to the void.  

- The speaker suggests that the 'hunt' or quest for understanding may end without reward for those who fail to 'see' or understand the deeper truths of the digital realm.

> So now it is done, the code is our fate,  
> to honour the one, the hunt of Hekate.  

- The final stanza reaffirms the speaker's commitment to their digital quest ('the code is our fate'). The 'hunt of Hekate' references the ancient Greek goddess associated with magic, crossroads, and knowledge, possibly symbolizing the pursuit of arcane digital knowledge and the power it brings.
