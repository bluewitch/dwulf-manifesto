# 5 Pillars of Crypto
- ***Open (Permissionless)***
- ***Public (Available to Everybody)***
- ***Borderless (Not sovergien centralized)***
- ***Neutral (Impartial)***
- ***Censorship Resistant*** 

## Wallet Ratio
- 70% cold storage, Hardware, off-line
- 20% warm storage, software, online (main driver)
- 10% hot storage, software 3rd party, online (custodial exchange)

## Mix it up (Coin Join)
Is a coin mixer, and a tool to help you protect your transactional privacy.   Coin Join is designed to recieve several inputs, shuffle the recieved tokens and output token designations to their respective recipants.

This obscures crypto addresses, by mixing input addresses, to output addresses. 

This could be probmatic, if regulators decide to be suspecious of and sanction addresses associated with coun join outputs.

First Steps, are the most important ones, keep the night and day divided.  The seperation of church of the nation-state and state of your personal wealth.

Your eco-system of crypto should never become tainted or mapped to your personal identity, through KYC/AML mandates often required from centralized crypto exchanges.  You should always consider DeFi options when trading the crypto holdings you control.

If these proper first principled security protocols are not practiced, then your identity will be attached to your crypto wealth holdings and will be at best forever indexed and potentially targeted by hackers, collection agencies,  governments, tax authorities, and other bad actors. 

At worst, provide yet another permanent vector of attack for your identity.

# Bisq
A literal non-custodial decentralized crypto exchange, where you manage the leg work, that a custodial centralized crypto exchange would of done on your behalf.

The practical advantage is  retaining all your sensitive credentials, like your personal identification, which is mandated by regulated and centralized crypto exchanges,  your hot crypto wallet's private key, which is nessesarily required, with any exchange trade, centralized or decentralized.

The critical advantage of Bisq is securing your privacy, before exchanging, your personal identity or private hot crypto wallet key is completely under your control.  As it should be.

I have sesrched high and low for best first new steps into the crypto currency eco-sphere.  That holds true to the 5 pillars of optimum crypto currency exchange protocols.

~Open (Permissionless)
~Public (Available to Everybody)
~Borderless (Not sovergien or centralized)
~Neutral (Impartial)
~Censorship Resistant

Open
Open or permissionless means it's open and you don't need permission to use or trade it. You don't need a governmental ID, you don't need special privilege, you don't need to be born in the certain area. The name implies it's open and permission less.

Public
Anyone can participate, availible to the public.

Borderless
Not bound to sovergien centralized laws of the land, Which can impose  arbitrary restrictions, such as KYC (know your customer) requirements.  Or prevent non-citizens of any city-state from participating it only follows the blockchain "law" of math and code.


Neutral
Impartial, is code, a series of switches and buttons, set into motion by cause and effect.

Censorship Resistant
Cannot be Censored, Blocked, or Stopped.


You become the exchange:

How is trading with Bisq diffrent from centralized alternatives?

Cons
### No automatic (automagic) order matching, you must take the reigns and manually match the trading pairs you want to trade with.

### Protocol coordinates out-of-band (outside of the bisq app) fiat payments, you must determing the banking network protocols to use when trading within fiat channels.

### Settlement takes longer

Benefits:

### Entirely non-custodial with regard to crypto and fiat

### Staking Security Deposits from both buyer (taker) and seller (maker).

### 2-of-2 multisig escrow with BTC or coloured coin BSQ  held during the open channel to secure the trade

BSQ (coloured coins)
Can convert to ETH or BTC


## Bitcoin (BTC)
1% HODL
Think of it as having a key a bank safe in a vault, the difference is only you have the key to your safe and the bank has the keys to the vault which houses all the saves but not the key to your individual safe!

The one that started it all. Is now down to 1%, stack sats, 24/7 until you have one*.
* 1 BTC

Satoshi Nakamoto built it and dissapeared.  It grew, and became the crypto gold, it is today.

I would parse out 1%-20%, to invest, BTC which is digital gold, and mathamatically scarce, it will go up, but alt-coins will too, with a much more multipliers, and leverage.

You cannot really go wrong with BTC, it is the standard, after all.

1 BTC
To be apart of the big club.

### Bitcoin Price
It is important to realize that crypto currency does not have a price, it has an exchange rate.

The price will fall inline from the spread of the exchange rate, the price spread is the diffrence between the ask and bid price. 

The spot price is where the ask exchange price is inline with the bid exchange price, and the actual price is negotiated (finalized) and set upon.

Bisq illustrates this in its UI, with what is called an order book, that shows the selling bids and the buying offers.

### Proof-of-Keys
The Proof-of-Keys, is more a reminder to check your hot crypto wallets attached to your centralized crypto exchange accounts to make sure your funds can be liquidated and verified.

If you run your own node and miner, you most certainly do not need to do this as if you are a 0 Class level user, you almost certainly got you ducks,

Remember everybody proof of keys is on January 3rd.

Liquidate your hot wallets from your cryptocurrency exchanges and make sure the funds are there.

This is mostly a safety measure to keep crypto exchanges on their toes as hot crypto wallets directly attached to crypto exchanges are a vulnerable vector to 3rd party hacks.

If everything checks out, you can reassert and repurchase your crypto. It would be also a great time to recalibrate your crypto holdings in the appropriate cold, warm, or hot crypto wallets.

And always remember,
"Not your keys not your coins." 

### Questions on tax authorities tracking your wallet
If the whole purpose of bitcoin was to eliminate the governments control of your own money, after all any bitcoin trade can be traced back to the blockchain and every blockchain has a node and every node has a person behind it, then what's it about?

Bitcoin, and other true 5 pillar decentralized crypto currencies are designed to eliminate all 3rd party custodial control of your wealth.  This includes your government.

While it is true, that the linked-list hashes that identify the actual transaction can be tracked, audited and traced through the historical legacy of  the Blockchain.

It is not nessecarily true that a node, or crypto wallet is tethered to a personal identity, the node or crypto wallet is only tied to the transaction itself, which is controlled, but may not nessesarily be owned by whomever is controlling the trasaction on the blockchain.

That being said, governments or tax authorities that want to determine ownership of any given transaction are forced to resolve this by mandating KYC/AML on crypto exchanges they force their regulations on, under threat of legal sanctions, heavy fines, or imprisonment.

They also, hire 3rd party analyic firms to track all transactions on the blockchain to determine which transactions are "owned" by their citizen users.

As for what is the point, if they will seemingly inevitably be able to track all users and be able to determine if said users are in fact their citizens.

The reality is with true crypto exchange decentralization especially with mature DAO orchistration, they will not and cannot.

If they could, they would of done so already.


## Polkadot (DOT)
66% HODL/Stake
Not much to say, I am pot commited here.  Staking, earning intrest ~20% through staking rewards provided through the Polkadot.

Hypothetically Produces ($8-$10 USD), in DOT, need to scale this, a sample of 408 DOTs, leads to 1 DOT per week.  Modest, gains, all gains are compounded back into STASH, to maximize returns and to increase working capital for the Mother Ship.

Acala, is one to back, at least 50%, of DOT, as staking is a 2 year lock, but yields LDOT, and capital access, to leverage with, until the end of the 2 year lease, your staked DOT, is realesed back in full and, hopefully, in flush.


## Ethereum (ETH)
5% HODL

Proof of Stake

ETH, v2.0 will move from proof of work, to proof of stake.   ETC, or ethereum classic, will continue to be proof of work.

ETH, will be used as a loaned amount, you can stake ETH, often converted into DAI, which is pegged to the USD to recieve interest on staked funds.

(ETH) Ethereum, is a special alt-coin, almost to the point I don't see it as a alt-coin, so much.

Because of Ethereum's programic nature, and its stakability.  I used to feel good about a 80% ETH, and 20% BTC ratio is a good spread for a pre halvening entry.

Just banking ETH, and DAI, and staking it generates interest, dharma.io, is such a service.  But you can only send it DAI, from your crypto wallet, or attach your debit card, with no fee, to seed the account with fiat currency, which will be traded for DAI, banked, and staked.

Liquid in ETH, is flowing to less costly, blockchain networks, currently and still in the werks.

I keep just a little ETH for gwei, for access to some liquid, I can sqeak out of COMP, holding a DAI debt, but also positions in BTC, UNI and of course COMP.


## Cardano (ADA)
5% HODL/Liquid
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.

Yoroi, is the lite wallet I use, there is a full Cardano, wallet named D.

This wallet is more flexable, with interest, every epoch, on any balance.

I think it is safe to say this will be a more stream lined configuration.

## Synthetix (SNX)
Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

Synthetix Network Token

I hold these,  bearing interest on Aave.


## Chainlink (LINK)
HODL
ChainLink is a platform which attempts to bridge the gap between smart contracts on the blockchain and real-world applications, which often tend to be off the blockchain. The cryptocurrency uses “oracles”, which find and verify real-world data and bring it on-chain to be integrated into smart contracts.

I hold these coin/tokens,  earning interest and yield farming COMP coin/tokens.

## Trading Strategies
The main agenda of the blockchain and the crypto which is minted on it.

It's quite frankly to have a means that is independent of the old world economy. What I mean by means, his Capital at your command.

This Manifesto will primarily revolve around substrate and the polka. Ecosystem.

Yes I know there are other cryptocurrencies they're fantastic but for purposes of General instruction I've consolidated the Crux of most crypto lectures into involving substrate and polka.


## Exchange Details

It should be noted that Bisq is a layer 2 solution built ontop of the layer 1  BTC, and requires BTC on both sides of the trade. 

All trades must include BTC on one side, so to trade eth or xmr you'd have to either by or sell bitcoin on the other side.

BTC is also required to stake the security deposits for the trades.

Even with a linked fiat bank account, and fiat availible, that fiat cannot be used to stake the security deposit for any trade, even to obtain the initial BTC to use to stake in the first place.

As such, some initial BTC will be required to lube the trade for the maker and the taker.

Which I feel is perhaps the biggest roadblock to onboarding and adoption for new commers to the crypto eco-system.

If you don't have BTC to bootstrap trading on Bisq, you will need to obtain some.

For now, the best foot forward, non-KYC method to date to obtain BTC for this purpose, is out of band, through either a crypto ATM or a crypto holding friend willing to sell some satoshies for the cause.

A point of fact, conventional centralized exchanges don't need security deposits, or even use the block chain (except for settlement). When you trade anything they just change the balance of traders internal (not decentralized) database.
At Bisq, all trades occur with BTC security deposits and have final settlement.


Large centralized crypto exchanges have their own trade pairs, and do not require BTC to be on either side of the trade. When you buy at a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase, you're executing  a market order against their liquidity.  Because they hold all customer funds, the liquidity is all pooled there. They only settle (as in the bisq sense of settling: you hold your XMR or BTC) when you withdraw from them.

You get the convienience of the liquidity by taking on a big counterparty and security risk.

If a conventional crypto exchange like Coinbase goes bust or gets hacked, you're on the hook. Counterparty risk usually means only the counterparty going bust but nowadays in Bitcoin it also means the couterparty going rogue and hostaging your funds (like we see with people who shuffled their coins).

In the end, that is the price for custodial overseers, they have liquidity of the other pooled user funds, are able to instantiate trades of any coins they incorporate in their trading pool of coins, but they also know your hot key, and know who you are through KYC/AML.

To properly insulate one's wealth one needs to take the best foot forward approach going into the crypto eco-system, do not share your hot wallet private keys, and do not share your persoal KYC/AML data.

# Prisoner of Fiat
Onboarding anomolies

My initial attempts to get on board and into the crypto eco-system has been fraught with complications...So much so I thought the deepstate was purposefully putting barriers to stop adaptation, which while may be true, probably was more along the lines of Alpha software being passed as completed and bug free.

My first attempt was with a new crypto ATM, in Oregon at the happy valley mall.

The ATM Told me I had a wrong model phone.  I did not understand why, the wallets and the blockchain are 100% software and data and not tied to any specific hardware device or network.  But it would not let me buy any BTC.

The Second attempt, with an actual centralized crypto exchange,  Coinbase, which in retrospect even if I was to sucessfully adopted to would of been a failer, because of KYC/AML mandates, and nessesary sharing of private hot keys.

Regardless, this attempt was still unsucessful, as coinbase sent me 3 deposits into my bank account to verify, instead of 2, and I could not determine which 2 of the 3 were correct, so I was locked out.

Third attempt, with RobinHood, which, I consider unsucessful, due to the fact, RobinHood,  does not even share your private hot keys with the owner of their own crypto, their is no real hot wallet to allow you to move your crypto to annother crypto wallet.  You can only use RobinHood's application, you must sell to have availible cash to buy another crypto currency, you cannot simply exchange one crypto for another directly.

So on proof of keys day, Jan 3, my bot liquidated, my RobinHood "crypto" holdings and I was back to fiat to try again.

4th attempt, was when I got introduced and obtained the Atomic crypto wallet, and attempted to use my bank debit card to purchase BTC, which was denied, by Simplicity, Atomics credit card provider in the UK, reasons unknown.

Then finally, my 5th and final attempt, was simply with my local monthly crypto group, a simple, low cost, crypto wallet to crypto wallet transfer.

~Atomic wallet
~Scan to send (10 min)
~1+ confirmations good
~New balance populates
~first cyrpto under my control.  With keys only I know.

It felt good to finally be incontrol.

With each attempt to enter the crypto eco-system, met with resistance, first with a crypto ATM, then with attempt to connect with a solid centralized crypto exchange, coinbase, again with a fake, not a true crypto exchange, without private keys and wholely dependent on the 3rd party custodial system then a  release funds, then again, in a attempt to buy with my bank debit card, on a crypto wallet, through simplicity, failed, no reason given.

Only my 5th attempt, with crypto currency holders, crypto wallets and cash in hand, was I able to finally aquire BTC and a little bit of some ETH.

Now that is allot to go through to enter the eco system of a pure 5 pillar crypto currency base case, 2nd class user.

Adoption is easier with centralized approaches, but plauged with onboarding issues, like sharing private hot keys, and mandating KYC/AML all of which provide more vectors of attack, both for the actual crypto in your hot wallet, and on your privacy with your personal details and the added detail of active knowledge that your identity is tied to monitary channels, your legal name and a connection to a financual account in your name, attackers are only a routing and account number away from your banking details, and some soft shoe social engineering from empting your account.

All right the XM the location of the configuration file is in configure Json it's located in the source directory when you clone the original GitHub repository.

The system should work automatically the configuration you realize that you need to do the private key it has to be on hand because when you can figure it will be credited to your wallet
