## Exchange Details

It should be noted that Bisq is a layer 2 solution built ontop of the layer 1  BTC, and requires BTC on both sides of the trade. 

All trades must include BTC on one side, so to trade eth or xmr you'd have to either by or sell bitcoin on the other side.

BTC is also required to stake the security deposits for the trades.

Even with a linked fiat bank account, and fiat availible, that fiat cannot be used to stake the security deposit for any trade, even to obtain the initial BTC to use to stake in the first place.

As such, some initial BTC will be required to lube the trade for the maker and the taker.

Which I feel is perhaps the biggest roadblock to onboarding and adoption for new commers to the crypto eco-system.

If you don't have BTC to bootstrap trading on Bisq, you will need to obtain some.

For now, the best foot forward, non-KYC method to date to obtain BTC for this purpose, is out of band, through either a crypto ATM or a crypto holding friend willing to sell some satoshies for the cause.

A point of fact, conventional centralized exchanges don't need security deposits, or even use the block chain (except for settlement). When you trade anything they just change the balance of traders internal (not decentralized) database.
At Bisq, all trades occur with BTC security deposits and have final settlement.


Large centralized crypto exchanges have their own trade pairs, and do not require BTC to be on either side of the trade. When you buy at a centralized crypto exchange like Coinbase, you're executing  a market order against their liquidity.  Because they hold all customer funds, the liquidity is all pooled there. They only settle (as in the bisq sense of settling: you hold your XMR or BTC) when you withdraw from them.

You get the convienience of the liquidity by taking on a big counterparty and security risk.

If a conventional crypto exchange like Coinbase goes bust or gets hacked, you're on the hook. Counterparty risk usually means only the counterparty going bust but nowadays in Bitcoin it also means the couterparty going rogue and hostaging your funds (like we see with people who shuffled their coins).

In the end, that is the price for custodial overseers, they have liquidity of the other pooled user funds, are able to instantiate trades of any coins they incorporate in their trading pool of coins, but they also know your hot key, and know who you are through KYC/AML.

To properly insulate one's wealth one needs to take the best foot forward approach going into the crypto eco-system, do not share your hot wallet private keys, and do not share your persoal KYC/AML data.
