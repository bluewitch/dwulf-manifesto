# The book of the wizard, is divided into 3 foci, First Principles,  DevOps, and Blockchain.

## First Principles
First Principles, are the building blocks of the book, as always we start with the primitives,  
Integers, Strings, etc., then build the Arrays, and Vectors.  Then the Objects you desire.

With native interface and object manipulation proficiency with the BASH terminal and the primitives of programming languages of the machine there is no problem that cannot be configured to werk.

- First Principles
- JavaScript, node.js
- Python, flask, django, Tensorflow, pynum,
- Rust, Bevy, Amethist, webgl, webgpu,


## DevOps
Is the CI/CD workflow. Installing OS, Updating and Uprading, Git Repo Build with dependencies.  Linting and Unit Testing, auto merging.

Creating a pristine working (bug free) image.

- DevOps
- OS Workspace, linux
- Tools, JavaScript Node.js (NPM), Rust (Cargo),
- Co Ops, Ansible Docker, k8


## Blockchain
Is all inclusive, to represent development of Substrate and Rust, Price Analytics Oracle for price of other Blockchains and conventional regulatory news.

Is the means and the money, to provide options to implement from.

Experience in this will set one to self custodial crypto wallets, lighting node operations,  and management of full validators, and delegators.

- Crypto Blockchain
- Solidity, Vipr, Substrate
- Smart Contract
- DeFi, Terra Luna, Astar Plasm

Fresh accounts,  should be incepted through a air gapped, cold hardware wallet, trezor, or nano x.  with crypto steel.

## Raspberry Pi (MyNode) Lightning.

MyNode Lighting Node
(ARM, 1TB, 4 GIG RAM)

Avado
(i7, 2TB, 32 GIG RAM)
