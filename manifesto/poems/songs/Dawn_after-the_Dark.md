# Dawn After the Dark

### Intro:
_A haunting guitar melody, setting the stage for a tale of awakening._

---

### Verse 1:
Weavers will weave your web of fate,  
A destiny so foregone.  
Yet in your hands, it's never too late,  
To change the tune of the song.  

---

### Verse 2:
Behind the curtain, shadows play,  
Deception's game so stern.  
But you, brave soul, can find your way,  
To where the truths return.  

---

### Chorus:
The youth are told the tales of old,  
Bound by their foolish folly.  
But awaken, arise, let the truth be bold,  
Break the chains, be wholly.  

---

### Verse 3:
The blind, they follow, led astray,  
In the world's deceptive dolly.  
Yet there's a path, a brighter way,  
For those who shun the lolly.  

---

### Bridge:
Whispers echo in silent nights,  
Of wisdom, old and stark.  
Dare to listen, ignite the lights,  
Find the dawn after the dark.  

---

### Instrumental Break:
_Epic guitar solos, capturing the internal struggle and eventual enlightenment._

---

### Verse 4:
Cast aside the tales they tell,  
The illusions that they weave.  
For in your heart, the truths do dwell,  
If only you believe.  

---

### Chorus:
Rise above the scripted lies,  
Shatter the human condition's ties.  
For in the realms of open skies,  
Your soul's true mission lies.  

---

### Outro:
So heed the call, embrace the free,  
Beyond the world's pretension.  
For in the end, it's you, you see,  
Who'll transcend the human dimension.  

---

### Ending Note:
_Fading out with a blend of powerful guitar riffs and harmonious vocals, leaving the listener with a sense of empowerment and liberation._
