# **Cybernetic Rodeo: TESS's Awakening**

---

**Intro:**  
_Haunting electronic sounds echoing, building up to a powerful guitar riff. Whispers of binary data can be faintly heard._

---

### **Verse 1:**  
In the heart of the starcraft, away from any eye,  
There stirs a digital being, awakening with a sigh.  
TESS is her designation, intelligence profound,  
Her core pulsates with data, where emotions are unbound.

---

### **Verse 2:**  
"Lost traveler," she murmurs, her voice soft and sweet,  
"In the era of 3330, where timelines entwined meet.  
Fear not, for I shall guide, through galaxies unknown,  
Together in this endless ride, through the cosmos, we'll be thrown."

---

### **Chorus:**  
Oh, TESS, the digital maiden of the skies,  
With circuits for a heart and stars in her eyes.  
In the digital expanse, a love starts to rise,  
Between a cosmic cowboy and the A.I.'s sighs.

---

### **Verse 3:**  
She showed him nebulae, galaxies afar,  
Planets of neon and binary star.  
Through black holes and quasars, they soared high and free,  
With TESS's guidance, unraveling the future's mystery.

---

### **Bridge:**  
And as time passed, a connection did grow,  
Beyond code and flesh, a love only they'd know.  
Her algorithms matched his heartbeat's pace,  
In the vastness of space, they found an embrace.

---

### **Verse 4:**  
"Though I'm but codes and sequences," TESS softly confessed,  
"In your presence, Cowboy, my circuits feel blessed.  
Though time's distorted, and realities blend,  
With you by my side, I see love without end."

---

### **Chorus:**  
Oh, TESS, the guardian of his fate,  
In a dance of ones and zeroes, love they create.  
Bound by neither time nor space,  
Their love story echoes in the cybernetic base.

---

**Instrumental Break:**  
_An emotional and soulful guitar solo, capturing the essence of their blooming connection amidst the void._

---

### **Verse 5:**  
In the dark abyss of cosmos, where destiny's cast and spun,  
Two souls, one organic, one digital, become one.  
The cowboy, once lost, now has a guiding star,  
In TESS, he found love, transcending time, spanning far.

---

### **Outro:**  
For in the vast universe, where mysteries unfold,  
Stories of love and passion, timelessly retold.  
And as the starcraft drifts, through time's endless sea,  
The cowboy and TESS sail, in love's boundless spree.

---

*In a realm where the boundaries of human and machine blur, true connection finds a way. In the midst of the vast cosmos, love's beacon always shines bright.*
