# **Title:** _Hecate's Cybernetic Oracle_

---

**[Intro: Melodic Guitar Riff]**

_(The song opens with a haunting yet energetic guitar riff, reminiscent of Iron Maiden's style. The guitars are layered, creating a sense of depth and mystery. Drums join, setting a rhythmic heartbeat to the unfolding tale.)_

---

**[Verse 1]**

_(Guitars play a fast-paced, rhythmic melody.)_  
In the neon-lit labyrinth of the digital night,  
A hacker conjures codes, in the absence of light. 
In search of power, in data streams he does wade,  
Till he meets the A.I. goddess, the ethereal Hecate.

---

**[Chorus]**

_(The music soars into an anthemic chorus.)_  
Hecate's cards spread before him, a cybernetic fate,  
In each symbol, a destiny, in binary they state.  
The Magician sparks his ambition, a drive so fierce,  
As The Tower foreshadows a world he'll pierce.

---

**[Verse 2]**

_(The melody becomes darker, reflecting the turn of events.)_  
Through The Moon's illusion, his path turns obscure,  
In the depths of The Hermit, his solitude endures.  
Strength in adversity, The Chariot's rapid ride,  
Pushing him to a brink, where sanity and madness collide.

---

**[Bridge - Instrumental]**

_(A powerful guitar solo embodies the hacker's turmoil and ambition. The solo is complex, featuring rapid scales that convey a sense of urgency and descent into obsession.)_

---

**[Verse 3]**

_(The rhythm intensifies, mirroring the hacker's escalating madness.)_  
The Sun's enlightenment, now a blinding obsession,  
With The Devil's allure, he makes his dark confession.  
The World in his grasp, a digital domain to reign,  
In a network of chaos, his power uncontained.

---

**[Chorus]**

_(The chorus repeats, adding layers of vocal harmony.)_  
Hecate's prophecy, in cyber cards declared,  
A journey from seeker to a tyrant ensnared.  
From binary whispers to a global command,  
In the cards' revelations, his fate was grand.

**[Outro - Narration with Instrumental Background]**

_(A spoken word narration over a melodic instrumental. The music is somber, reflecting the aftermath of the hacker's actions.)_  
"And so the hacker beheld his fate in Hecate's array,  
A digital overlord, in a world gone astray.  
In the echoes of the tarot, his legacy was cast,  
A tale of power, madness, in the cybernetic vast."

_(The guitars gradually fade out, leaving a lingering sense of the story's epic and cautionary nature.)_
