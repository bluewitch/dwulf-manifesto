# W2 I work for me or I work for you

> The battle for the W-2, I work for me or I work for you.

_The poem begins with a direct statement about the conflict between self-employment (I work for me) and traditional employment (I work for you), symbolized by the W-2 form in the US._

> The details of an employment compact,
> Bundled in an at will contract.

_The speaker refers to the complexity of employment agreements, suggesting they might often be to the disadvantage of the worker._

> 1/3 or more your coin deducted,
> As indentured servitude is instructed.

_The speaker emphasizes the amount of earnings taken away in taxes, equating this to a form of modern "indentured servitude."_

> Stake your coin as is the mandates,
> For all the years to follow.
> A careful craft of Freedom substrates,
> Because slavery is hard to swallow.

_The speaker suggests that the system is structured to extract a share of workers' earnings over many years, using the language of freedom to make it more palatable._

> But time and pressure realize, future options just got slimmer.

_The speaker acknowledges that as time passes and pressure mounts, future opportunities appear more limited._

> And then you see with real eyes,
> The lies that called you winner.

_The speaker suggests that clarity (seeing with "real eyes") reveals the deceptive nature of the system, which promises success but delivers limitations._

> A city-state, that forced your fate, and told you what you're good for.
> The illusion of choice, and the power of voice.
> Showed all, but the 1 door.

_The speaker discusses societal constraints that dictate individuals' roles and limit their choices._

> And now you stand at the end of time, your essence all but spent.
> Your masters are not so kind, pushed to the trash bin you are sent.

_The speaker emphasizes the expendability of workers in this system, treated with little kindness or consideration._

> To cut your loss, they receive their gain, their fortune on the back of your pain.

_The speaker asserts that the system profits from the workers' suffering._

> A trinket here, a bauble there, and words they spoke to charm you.
> Their promises where open air,
> They broke them when they were through.

_The speaker implies that workers are placated with small rewards and broken promises._

> So when you go job hunting, or looking for a patron master.
> Know just how deep, your freedoms are cutting, to keep you from disaster.

_The speaker urges the reader to understand the extent of their sacrifice when entering the job market._

> It never really is so clear, the terms of the engaument.
> But only the wise know how to shear, a duty from enslavement.

_The speaker suggests that understanding the true conditions of employment and finding ways to retain freedom within them requires wisdom._

> But the cost of progress is sometimes worth its price.
> It takes no act of congress to trade your life for spice.

_The speaker admits that progress may come at a high price, and it's up to the individual to decide whether to trade their freedom for "spice" (potentially representing material gain or pleasure)._

> The world keeps on spinning, as the masters keep on winning.
> The fish will just keep swimming, as the fisher king keeps grinning.

_The speaker concludes with the cyclical nature of the system â€“ the world keeps turning, the powerful keep profiting, and the ordinary people (the "fish") keep striving, while those who benefit (the "fisher king") remain content._
