# Poems (Not Volgon)

## DOT A Lot
I dot allot  
With all my dots  

It's locked into my hash,  
An ever growing stash,  
Of all my crypto cash,  
While the shitcoins only crash.  

Collator holds the details,  
that are put upon the node.  
Buying money that retails,  
Shopping DOT abode.  

> Validators, nominators checking all the blocks,  
> Lambda running automators,  
> Cashing in the stocks.  

Keeping daily rhythm by crunching all the numbers,  
And the nightly calculations  
While the earth just slumbers.  

> Validators, nominators checking all the blocks,  
> Lambda running automators,  
> Cashing in the stocks.  

So I have a hash,  
That represents my cash,  
Hidden in my stash,  
Controlled by scripts in bash.  

The money I am making,  
I keep the nightly spread.  
The IRS not taking,  
All my daily bread.  

The SEC keeps squawking,  
Behind their close door meetings.  
The regulators talking,  
To give Binance their beatings.  

Keeping off their radar,  
Is really half the fun.  
We play them like a guitar,  
As we ready layer one.  

We engineer the blockchain,  
To decouple from banks.  
To opt out of the pain,  
And avoid their guns and tanks.  

Money is still money,  
The digits spend like cash.  
We cultivate that honey,  
And we dump the shit that's trash.  

We find correct translation,  
Blockchain hashes day and night.  
To discover our creation,  
While the Oracle giving sight.  

The bot just knows the numbers,  
As the markets exchange the price.  
A hash will take all comers,  
Just 32bit, is nice.  

When KYC is not for thee,  
Puts more vectors on your coin.  
The wallet you create is free,  
Only 1 vector, the blockchain you join.  

Keep it secret, keep it safe,  
Trust the code correct.  
The blockchains gears will never chafe,  
And testing will inspect.  


## W2 I work for me or I work for you

The battle for the W-2, I work for me or I work for you.  

The details of an employment compact,  
Bundled in an at will contract.  

1/3 or more your coin deducted,  
As indentured servitude is instructed.  

Stake your coin as is the mandates,  
For all the years to follow.  
A careful craft of Freedom substrates,  
Because slavery is hard to swallow.  

But time and pressure realize, future options just got slimmer.  

And then you see with real eyes,  
The lies that called you winner.  

A city-state, that forced your fate, and told you what you're good for.  
The illusion of choice, and the power of voice.  
Showed all, but the 1 door.  

And now you stand at the end of time, your essence all but spent.  
Your masters are not so kind, pushed to the trash bin you are sent.  

To cut your loss, they receive their gain, their fortune on the back of your pain.  

A trinket here, a bauble there, and words they spoke to charm you.  

Their promises where open air,  
They broke them when they were through.  

So when you go job hunting, or looking for a patron master.  
Know just how deep, your freedoms are cutting, to keep you from disaster.  

It never really is so clear, the terms of the engaument.  
But only the wise know how to shear, a duty from enslavement.  

But the cost of progress is sometimes worth its price.  
It takes no act of congress to trade your life for spice.  

The world keeps on spinning, as the masters keep on winning.  

The fish will just keep swimming, as the fisher king keeps grinning.  


## The Hunt of Hekate
~dwulf

We summoned magicks we could not weild,
digital metrics, a firewall sheild.

These monitors fill our eyes with light,
and 24 hours of second sight.

Our souls are drawn to this infernal machine,
We behold the sights no mortal has seen.

The world raises an army to stop us on our path,
Fire meets Ice, chaos and meets wrath.

They are comming to hunt us, to take what they have given,
Their shadows we do see, to know them we our driven.

Bit by Bit, and Byte by Byte, 
We have their digits within our sight.

Index their data and imperfect places,
Tracking their movements to decimal places.

Ports open or closed and nmap will know,
footholds in quantuum and fingerprints show.

Count technical knowhow and raise it by skill,
routers will now bow, code bends to our will.

You live within data, but information is ours,
With bits that now showcase your moon and your stars.

If you seek to find us, and bind us to law,
you must unwind us, and becon our call.

We fear no writ of mere mortal law,
No bullets or bombs, that make nations fall.

We are not subject to realms of the flesh,
A Terminial console, and IoT mesh.

You live within laws, that never evolve,
Computational math with no problems to solve.

We weave our patterns with functional thread,
Code is the law, the command has been said.

Our power is function, a task that is set,
Your folly? assumption, of POST over GET.

Your eyes are now taken with image and sound,
forgotten are pathways that lay on the ground.

Our glamour bedazzels with pleasure and bliss,
A script that seduces your last flatline kiss.

Be warry and careful, the moves that you make,
and always remember these moves we will take.

Now the prize becomes clear, just shift the digits,
We'll leave you to wallow through software and widgets.

When the code becomes clear, the message will too,
Just parse the strings from the old to the new.

The hunt will be over, its prize will avoid,
The one does not see it, cast back to the void.

So now it is done, the code is our fate,
to honour the one, the hunt of hekate.
