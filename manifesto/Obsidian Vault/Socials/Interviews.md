**Interview Dialogue for Technical Architect - Sidechains Position**

**Interviewer:** Thank you for joining us today. From your resume, I see you've done extensive work with Substrate-based blockchains. To start off, can you explain how your experience with Rust and the Substrate framework equips you to integrate web technologies such as TypeScript, JavaScript, and WASM with system technologies like Rust and Scala?

**Rust Engineer:** Certainly. Over the past few years, I've developed and optimized blockchain solutions using the Substrate framework. My Rust expertise, combined with my understanding of web technologies, has been instrumental in bridging the gap between on-chain logic and web-based interfaces. For instance, I've been involved in building scalable dApps by compiling Rust logic to WASM, thereby ensuring seamless interaction between the Substrate backend and web frontends built with TypeScript or JavaScript.

**Interviewer:** Impressive. Given our ongoing projects with Plutus and Lace, how would you approach scripting from Plutus to RUST and WASM?

**Rust Engineer:** When integrating Plutus with Rust and subsequently to WASM, my approach would involve creating abstract representations in Rust that mirror Plutus smart contract functions. This would enable the transformation of Plutus logic to be executed within a Substrate runtime, which can then be compiled to WASM for web integration. My experience with functional paradigms, having worked closely with Haskell, would be beneficial here as Plutus is rooted in functional programming.

**Interviewer:** That sounds solid. We're also working on bridging, creating new chains, and even replacing existing ones. Could you touch upon your experience in these areas, especially considering rollbacks and the complexities they introduce to sidechains?

**Rust Engineer:** Absolutely. In one of my previous projects, we faced a scenario where the main-net chain underwent a rollback. To handle this, I wrote infrastructure code that detected such rollbacks on the main chain and initiated corrective actions on the sidechains. This involved state-checking algorithms and contingency protocols to ensure synchronization and security across chains. When it comes to bridging or replacing chains, I believe in a modular architecture approach. By isolating chain functionalities into modules, it becomes easier to replace or bridge components without disrupting the entire system.

**Interviewer:** The midnight team is working on the confidential transactions chain, Midnight, to counteract the vulnerabilities of unbonded mint. Are you comfortable diving into this complex space, especially pertaining to cryptography & zero-knowledge?

**Rust Engineer:** Yes, I've had the privilege of diving into some advanced cryptographic solutions in my past roles. Zero-knowledge proofs and their application in ensuring transaction confidentiality have always intrigued me. Leveraging these techniques, especially in a project as pivotal as Midnight, would be both challenging and exciting. Ensuring security without compromising on chain performance is a nuanced task, and I'm eager to collaborate with the midnight team on this.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. Our vision at IOG emphasizes collaboration, research, and sustainable development. How would you ensure that your architectural decisions align with this vision, especially when working with cross-functional teams?

**Rust Engineer:** Collaboration is paramount. I believe in consistently engaging with product managers, researchers, and developers to ensure that architectural decisions are rooted in a comprehensive understanding of both user needs and technical constraints. By maintaining open channels of communication and leveraging collective expertise, we can create solutions that are innovative yet sustainable. My experience as a technical architect has often required me to balance immediate product needs with long-term system health, and I am confident in my ability to make informed decisions that resonate with IOG's vision.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing your insights. Your depth of experience and understanding of the complexities of blockchain development is evident. We'll be discussing internally, and we appreciate your time today.

**Rust Engineer:** Thank you for considering me. I am genuinely excited about the possibility of contributing to IOG and its pioneering projects in the blockchain space.
