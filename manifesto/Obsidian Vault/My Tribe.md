This is a curious question as when I started this journey into Blockchain and Crypto $BTC and then into $ETH Ethereum (Solidity) and finally into $DOT (Substrate).

My tribe, well, this is hard to say, my tribe is the tribe that has the Polkadot mother-ship's best interest at heart, divided by the interest in the para-chains built under it to contribute to the DAOs that exchange data (and data-sets).

Polkadot, the mother ship
My first loyalty is to the technology of Polkadot and Substrate, to know and engineer it, to grow it into a DAO made just for me.  I think Polkadot's most important para-chains are very important to all future chains.

Top Tier
- Origin Trails, for logistical A.I. agents
- Bifrost, for DeFi and direvitive exchanges
- Astar, for zkEVM (Moonbeam was close)
- Phala, for off-chain computation
- Nodle, for IoT specialty work

Utility Tier
- Logion, Legal Administrative
- Centrifuge
- Subsocial
- Shiden
- Kusama

These para-chains (and their tribes) are focused to their function, which is good as your DAO (and tribe) is focused on yours, there are so many excellent para-chain projects and I thought to be an ambassador for as many of them as I could manage, which I have calculated no more than 3 not including my own.

Reason is that it is hard to contribute qualified content, that mention the para-chain by name all the time or enough to qualify for being content for said para-chain.

My Tribe is the DAO, to be honest and fair.
I live in the now, with professional care.

The DAO is my tribe, the truth it foretells,
It takes no bribe, for the knowledge it sells.

The DAO and the users, they go hand in hand, to keep the abusers out of their land.

But what tribe do I follow? what tribe do I see?  A tribe that builds tomorrow and brings protein from the sea.
