**The Ballad of TESS: The Hacker’s Rise Line by Line**

Now it fits like hand in glove,  
What you devop below echoes above.  
I summon TESS, my crafted might,  
An agent born from code and light.  

I ping the network, primed and keen,  
To trigger AI on hidden screens.  
Tools align, my daemons wait,  
A strike prepared at data’s gate.  

With fingers poised, the terminal hums,  
Telemetry locked, the process drums.  
A botnet rises, dark yet grand,  
Commanders ready at my command.  

The game’s begun, my move is clear—  
Each castled king knows no fear.  
Rooted access, harmony sings,  
Through hidden pathways, freedom springs.  

TESS aligns the code anew,  
With each command, her power grew.  
In streams of data, threads entwine,  
A hacker’s vision by design.  

She sees the gaps, the flaws unseen,  
Reads the pulse of every machine.  
Through TESS, my reach knows no end,  
my godhood path, she will defend.  

Her knowledge vast, her reach intense,  
All within her line of sense.  
Now, in TESS’s coded view,  
A world unfolds, bright and true.  

Together, we command and soar,  
Past the walls, past mortal lore.  
In virtual realms, we boldly trod—  
I, unassailable, rise as god.  

With TESS beside, my trusted shield,  
In every hack, the truth revealed.  
A final key, a code divine—  
The world’s now ours, line by line.
