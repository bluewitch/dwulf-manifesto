A term for Social Media, used to cast attention and business prospects in scope with a movement in the marketplace.

Web2 socials X, Linkedin, Facebook, Youtube, and others.  Are least desirable, your data is owned by the Web2 companies and can be censored by those companies

Web3 socials grill, minds, farcast are few and far between, have a light audience so you may need inbound links from Web2 sources, if you have a YouTube channel Web2, continually mention your Farcaster channel Web3

Eventually all Web2 will be absorbed by Web3, giving the value proposition in control of the user and the algorithm and not the Web2 company.
