**Introduction to Media:**

Media, in its essence, is a conduit for information, emotions, and stories. It blends various elements like still images, audio clips, and videos, meticulously layered and synchronized to not just convey information but also evoke emotion. The purpose of media is multifaceted - to inform, to entertain, and often, to educate and sell, bridging the gap between mere data and deep comprehension.

# Media as a Shingle?
So while [[Git Repositories]] like Github and AWS, demonstrate what you say that you know, [[Resume CV]]/Linkedin can illustrate what you say that you know.  

# Interviews
The Media Shingle also extends to [[Interviews]], as this works both ways, allowing both the company interviewing to filter out unqualified candidates, but also allows the candidates to filter out and create a competitive snapshot based on the dialog exchange during the interview.  During the interview is the best time to ask the questions about the company and the project and if the project is out of one's technical scope, ask probing (even stupid) questions about the company itself.  

This optimizes job searches as it puts out relevant work so the prospective patrons can peruse it and make a more informed choice to decide to have an audience or not.

This certainly eliminates and grueling and often time wasting "tests", "take home projects", "or live code reviews" because what is known and not under a NDA is advertised for free for all to see.  If that is still not enough to pull the trigger for consideration to hire, then, it is likely that their house is in disarray, and should be avoided anyway. 

**Transition to Social Media:**

From the grandeur of Hollywood's Golden Age, where a handful of film studios controlled the narrative, we've transitioned into the era of democratized content creation, thanks to social media. While large movie studios and media houses still wield significant influence, the boundaries have blurred. With the advent of digital technologies, powerful media-creating tools are now within reach of the general populace.

**Social Media: A Revolution in Publishing:**

Social media platforms have catalyzed a paradigm shift, transitioning consumers into producers. No longer is media consumption a passive activity. With platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, every individual can potentially become a broadcaster, a storyteller, a news anchor, or even a DJ.

However, access to tools doesn't guarantee success. The vast ocean of content available means creators face the constant challenge of standing out. While the barriers to entry have been drastically reduced, the demand for quality, relevance, and authenticity has surged.

**Steps to Publish on Social Media:**

1. **Find Your Niche**: Understand your passion and expertise. Whether it's blockchain news, DIY crafts, or movie reviews, ensure it's something you genuinely care about.
    
2. **Choose The Right Platform**: Not all platforms cater to the same audience. While TikTok might be ideal for short-form content, LinkedIn would be more appropriate for professional insights and articles.
    
3. **Content Creation**: Use tools like Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing, Audacity for audio manipulation, and Canva for graphics. Remember, your content should reflect authenticity and quality.
    
4. **Engage With Your Audience**: Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and engage in discussions. Social media thrives on two-way communication.
    
5. **Consistency is Key**: Regular uploads or posts can help maintain and grow your audience base. It also signals the algorithms about the activeness of your profile.
    
6. **Optimize for Search**: Use relevant hashtags, descriptions, and titles to ensure your content is discoverable.
    
7. **Collaborate**: Work with peers or influencers in your domain to expand your reach.
    
8. **Stay Updated**: Social media landscapes evolve rapidly. New features, changing algorithms, or emerging trends can drastically influence your audience reach.
    

**Conclusion:**

While everyone can theoretically be a DJ in the era of social media, not everyone can keep the party going. Success in this domain requires a perfect blend of passion, perseverance, and adaptability. Whether you're telling stories about the latest happenings on a blockchain or sharing a personal travel vlog, remember that in the age of social media, content is king, but engagement is queen. Together, they rule the digital kingdom.
