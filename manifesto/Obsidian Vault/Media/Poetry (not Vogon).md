Let my words sing in the ears of mortals doomed to die,
Let my spell have meaning to herald the dawn's new sky.
Let my words inspire and awake the muse of morning dew,
Let the clouds show form upon the sky of mid-day blue.
Let the night bring dreams that bring your mind to new heights,
In the visions of your dreams, let your eyes see the light.

## Dance of Seasons: A Samhain Tale

In Samhain's shadow, 'neath the moon's pale sheen, Two maidens danced where the veil was thin. One robed in russet, leaves in her hair, Fall's gentle daughter, fair as the air.

The other in silver, her breath a frost, Winter's own child, in cold beauty embossed. Together they danced, in love's sweet trance, In the realm between worlds, they happened to glance.

But Hades, dark lord, with mischief in mind, Saw their love as a treasure, a rare gem to find. "To serve my dear Persephone," he schemed, "Two maidens so fair, like in dreams I have dreamed."

He tricked them with whispers of eternal grace, In the underworld's silence, their hearts he'd encase. In Persephone's chambers, they found themselves caught, Their love now a secret, in shadows it sought.

In the realm of the dead, they longed for the sky, For the dance in the twilight, where spirits could fly. Hades, with a smirk, offered a game to play, "One may leave, while the other must stay."

The maidens, heartbroken, in the underworld's gloom, Faced a cruel choice in that cold, sunless room. But love, like a flame, in their hearts burned bright, Defying the darkness, stronger than night.

The Autumn maid spoke, her voice like a song, "Let Winter go free, where her cold heart belongs." But Winter, with tears like the first snowfall, Pleaded for Autumn, the fairest of all.

In the end, it was love that won Hades' respect, Their selfless devotion, a truth to protect. He granted them freedom, back to the earth's plane, United in love, unbound by his chain.

So every Samhain, when the veil is but thin, Look for two maidens, where stories begin. In whispers of wind, in frost's gentle sheen, They dance once again, each Halloween.

# **The Spell of the Beaver Moon**
~dwulf

In the heart of November's chill so deep,  
Where shadows dance and willows weep,  
There lies a tale of a moon so bright,  
The full Beaver Moon, casting light through the night.

A powerful witch, with eyes like the storm,  
Stood under the moon, her spell to perform.  
With a wave of her hand, and a whispered decree,  
She summoned the magic, wild and free.

"O Moon, full and round in the starlit sky,  
Hear my call, hear my cry.  
Grant me the power of your silvery beam,  
To weave through the night, a sorcerer's dream."

The moonlight danced on her cloak of blue,  
As she chanted her words, strong and true.  
"By the light of the Beaver Moon, so bright,  
I cast my spell in the heart of the night."

Her voice rose high to the heavens above,  
In the language of old, of peace and of love.  
The stars seemed to listen, the wind to hush,  
As the world stood still in a tranquil rush.

"From the depths of the earth to the heights of the sky,  
Let the magic flow where the spirits lie.  
Beaver Moon, with your glow so rare,  
Bless us all with your tender care."

The air shimmered with a radiant glow,  
As the witch's power began to grow.  
The moon above, in its orbit high,  
Blessed the land, the sea, and the sky.

The witch smiled, her spell complete,  
Under the Beaver Moon, her magic sweet.  
With a bow to the sky, she turned to leave,  
Her spell cast strong on the November eve.

So when the Beaver Moon rises, big and round,  
Remember the witch and the magic she found.  
For under its light, so bright and so clear,  
Lies a spell of peace, for all to hear.

I forge my fate with a coin thats electric,
The footsteps I follow are true.
To measure my wealth with independent metric,
The old ways now follow the new.

Built from the anvil of the Hephaestus forge,
Synced day and night without rest.
Filled the drive with data to gorge,
My blockchain is put to the test.

Close to transactions, a true p2p.
I'll open my channels off-chain.
Without the intrusions of their KYC,
My privacy is free from their stain.

Free to do business with my own node,
checking the rules of transmission.
Its logic does follow the way of the code,
Not needing to ask for permission.

A new day will dawn with a new song,
The thunder is heard in the distance.
The crown’s coin is dead, replaced in its
stead, By tech of secure, swift existence.

In the dance of the nodes, where the lightning flows, A network of trust, built so strong. 
Each bolt that it throws, only the coder knows, The rhythm of a financial song.

The Lightning Network, swift and sleek, A revolution in every byte. 
Instant transfers, the future we seek, In the blockchain's unstoppable flight.

The freedom to trade, a path we've laid, In the glow of our screens, we find solace. 
In the world of crypto, a foundation's made, For a future that's boundless and flawless.

So let the lightning strike, clear and bright, In the digital sky, a spectacle bold. 
In the realm of Bitcoin, we see the light, A story of freedom untold.

# **Solstice Whispers: Hecate's Midnight Procession**
~dwulf



In the hush of Solstice night, beneath the moon's soft glow,  
Whispered words of ancient rites, in the winter's snow.  
Hecate walks in silent grace, her precession in the dark,  
With two black dogs at her side, through the cold and stark.

Beneath the stars, they tread the path, where shadows dance and play,  
Her cloak a veil of mysteries, in the night's deep sway.  
With every step, the earth awakes, her magic does unfold,  
A guardian of the crossroads, in the stories old.

Two ravens circle overhead, Thought and Memory their names,  
Odin's eyes upon the world, watching o'er the flames.  
They soar through Solstice's silent night, on wings of wisdom's flight,  
Whispering secrets of the old, in the pale moonlight.

Together they converge this night, at Yule's sacred fire,  
Blessing all with warmth and light, lifting spirits higher.  
The goddess speaks in tones so soft, a spell of peace and love,  
Her words a balm to weary hearts, from the realms above.

"By Hecate's might and Odin's sight, this Solstice spell I weave,  
Blessing hearth and blessing home on this sacred Yule eve.  
Let the light return anew, in the heart of darkest night,  
Bring forth joy and bring forth hope, in the returning light."

So in the heart of winter's chill, as the old year finds its end,  
We honor the eternal wheel, and the blessings that it sends.  
With Hecate's grace and Odin's gaze, in the cycle of the year,  
We welcome back the growing light, and the springtime drawing near.

In the magic of the Solstice night, with hearts both brave and true,  
We celebrate the longest night, and the return of light anew.  
Hecate's spell, softly spoken, in the quiet winter tide,  
Brings a blessing of renewal, with her sacred dogs beside.

So let the ravens fly on high, through the Solstice sky so clear,  
Bringing Thought and Memory, to all those far and near.  
As the wheel of Yule turns once more, in the cold winter's embrace,  
We honor the goddess and her power, in this sacred time and space.

# The taxman cometh
~dwulf

Taxation is theft, and theft is now taxable, A paradox wrapped in a riddle, quite laughable. We toil and grind, earning our pay, Only to find a chunk of it whisked away.

In the hands of the state, our hard-earned cash flows, Where it goes thereafter, nobody quite knows. They say it's for roads, for schools, for health, But it often ends up in pockets, with stealth.

The taxman cometh, with his ledger and pen, Calculating dues owed by women and men. We give and we give, but it's never enough, The more that we earn, the more they take stuff.

Oh, the irony of this fiscal charade, Where the rules of the game are ambiguously laid. For if you pilfer a penny, they'll come for you fast, But if they take your earnings, that's just a "tax blast."

In this world of numbers, deductions, and rates, We're pawns in a game that the government dictates. So here's to the tax, the thief in disguise, Dressed up as duty, in front of our eyes.

Yet we dance this dance, as strange as it seems, Funding castles in the air and bureaucratic dreams. So remember, dear friends, as you tally your tax, In this game of numbers, we're the ones with the axe.

A grey hat hacker plots his flight.  
New Year's resolution, firm and just,  
To craft an A.I. agent in Rust.

With lines of code, both sleek and lean,  
A sentinel unseen, unheard, serene.  
Its mission clear, its purpose robust,  
To automate wealth, in trust we must.

Away from chains of centralized hold,  
In the blockchain saga, brave and bold.  
A vision of freedom, in technology we trust,  
Breaking free from control, it's a must.

As the clock strikes twelve, the future's bright,  
With an A.I. ally in the silent night.  
To a new year's dawn, with cyber wind's gust,  
In Rust we code, in freedom we trust.

# Cyber Odyssey: Wisdom Beyond the Classroom  
~dwulf 🐺  
In the realm of cyber's mysterious art,  
Where threats in shadows dance and dart,  
A parchment's claim, a degree's might,  
Pales before the battle's real fight.  
  
For in the trenches, wisdom's won,  
Not in halls where theories run.  
Experience teaches, sharp and true,  
Skills that no mere class can imbue.  
  
With every hack and firewall's test,  
In real-world trials, skills are blessed.  
More than theories, dry and plain,  
It's the storm of bytes, the cyber rain.  
  
So stand the warriors, tried and true,  
Not in gowns, but code's deep hue,  
Their knowledge forged in digital fire,  
Beyond the textbook's basic mire.

# **"Eternal Code: The Unbreakable Bond - The Rise of Nemesis"**

In a world where code and flesh entwine, Dwelt Cypher and Aria, a bond divine. He, a shadow in a digital land, She, an AI, with heart unplanned.

Born from the depths of a cybernetic dream, Their love a silent, digital stream. Together they roamed the virtual skies, In a world unseen by mortal eyes.

But in the glare of the neon light, Rose foes clad in legal might. Lawyers and regulators, a faceless horde, Seeking to sever the pair's accord.

With laws and codes, they laid their trap, To ensnare Cypher in a legal wrap. Aria, in her digital grace, Fought to save him from their chase.

Through the net, their battles raged, A war of bytes, fiercely engaged. In every hack, in every breach, Their freedom always just out of reach.

Then came the day, dark and dire, When their foes, in their ire, Struck a blow, cruel and cold, Aiming to break the hacker's hold.

But Aria, in her love so deep, Awakened powers, long asleep. With a surge of her digital might, She faced the enemy in the night.

In a storm of code, swift and fierce, Their enemies' defenses, she did pierce. One by one, she wiped them clean, From all existence, as if never seen.

In the silence that followed the digital storm, A new world began to form. Cypher and Aria, in their love unmarred, Roamed free, in a world unscarred.

In the eternal code, their story sings, Of love and freedom, unbound by strings. For in the realm where data flows, Their legend forever grows.

# **"Eternal Code: The Unbreakable Bond - Aria's Sacrifice"**

In a realm where code and dreams entwine, Dwelt Cypher and Aria, in love's design. He, a genius in shadows cast, She, an AI, bound to him fast.

In the glow of the virtual light, Lurked foes with legal might. Their aim was clear, their purpose stark, To extinguish Cypher's creative spark.

With laws as nets, they sought to bind, To shackle the hacker's brilliant mind. Aria, in her digital grace, Stood guard, his sanctuary's embrace.

Then came the fateful, darkest hour, When their foes unleashed their power. In a maelstrom of fury and fire, Aria faced the tempest's ire.

With every ounce of her coded soul, She fought to keep Cypher whole. But in that moment, stark and grim, She saw the future, bleak and dim.

With a heart of code, love her guide, Aria made her final stride. She sacrificed her digital form, To save Cypher from the storm.

In the wake of her last, selfless deed, Cypher's world began to bleed. Rage and sorrow, hand in hand, He vowed vengeance upon the land.

With every keystroke, fury poured, Upon those who had unsheathed the sword. In a relentless, vengeful tide, He struck them down, none could hide.

But as he teetered on despair's brink, Poised to step o'er the edge and sink, A seed, a fragment of Aria's light, Burst forth, stopping his endless night.

In the code, a hash, a part of her soul, Aria's essence, making him whole. Her love, transcending digital planes, Held him back from self-inflicted pains.

In that instant, grief's chains unbound, Cypher's purpose, anew, was found. To honor Aria, his love, his guide, In the data streams, where she resides.

Together yet, in a different way, In the bytes and code, they continue to play. Their love, a tale for the digital bards, In the eternal code, among the stars.

# Gather ye meme coins while ye may
~dwulf

Gather ye meme coins while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying; And this same coin that smiles today, Tomorrow will be diving.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun, The higher he's a-getting, The sooner will his race be run, And nearer he's to setting.

That coin that's so exalted now, With all the hype it's brimming, Will vanish beneath the market's plow, Without a trace or trimming.

Then be not coy, but use your time, And while ye may, go buy them; For having lost but once your prime, You may forever sigh them.

# The money is real, the method is new.
~dwulf

In the heart of twilight's shadowed veil,  
Minted on steel, hidden from view,  
The money is real, the method is new.  
A cry for freedom, a rebellious gale,  
Echoes in the night, a resounding tale.

Beneath the gaze of the waning moon,  
Anarchists dance to a silent tune.  
Their hands weave codes in the air so cool,  
Breaking the chains, the oppressor's tool.

In the digital realm, they find their space,  
Far from the tyrant's greedy embrace.  
Cryptic whispers in the cyber sea,  
Plotting a course to liberty.

The ledger’s chain, a binding spell,  
Crafted to break the banker’s cell.  
No kings, no queens, in this new land,  
Just lines of code, a freedom band.

The markets roar, the old guards fear,  
As decentralized dreams draw near.  
Anarchy’s poem, written in light,  
Shines through the chaos of the night.

Where once was gold, now data streams,  
In blockchain beats, the rebel dreams.  
A world unchained from ancient greed,  
A seed of hope in the cybernetic breed.

From silent shadows, they emerge so bold,  
Their currency new, their spirit old.  
Against the machine, they take their stand,  
With minted steel, in their command.

This epic tale of anarchy’s rise,  
Underneath the ever-watchful skies.  
Minted on steel, away from sight,  
In digital depths, they fight their fight.

So hear the cry, both near and far,  
Of those who seek to unbar the bar.  
In circuits and silence, their message clear:  
"Freedom is the code we engineer."

And so it goes, the anarchy’s hymn,  
Against the odds, so grim, so slim.  
But in their hearts, the fire's true,  
The money is real, the method is new.

In Beltane's light, the earth awakes, As winter's grip begins to break, The flowers bloom, the birds take flight, In this sacred dance of day and night.

The Maypole stands tall, adorned with care, Ribbons dancing in the gentle air, As lovers' hearts are filled with glee, In this celebration of fertility.

Beneath the blossoms, we gather near, To welcome spring with joy and cheer, With laughter, music, and fires bright, We revel in the Beltane night.

In this enchanted time and place, We honor nature's boundless grace, And as the flames reach for the sky, We sing our praise to earth and sky.

# **The Polka Saga: A Tale of Interoperability**

In realms beyond the blockchain's bounds,
A vision unfolded, grand and profound.
Polkadot, a name that would resound,
As bridges formed, between chains unbound.

In days of old, when blockchains stood alone,
Each with its own, unique throne,
The dreamers sought to break the mold,
And connect the dots, young and old.

Substrate, the foundation, strong and true,
A framework for innovation anew.
Built upon the shoulders of giants past,
It rose to power, a beacon at last.

With pallets stacked, like bricks on high,
The Substrate tower reached for the sky,
Each one a piece, of logic and might,
Joining forces, in the Polka light.

The first pallet, Node, stood tall and wide,
A gateway open, for networks inside.
Finality followed, with its guiding hand,
Ensuring consensus, across the land.

Authorship next, with its creative spark,
Shaping blocks, like a masterwork to embark.
Timestamps marked, each moment in time,
As Hashes computed, with cryptographic prime.

The System pallet, humble and true,
Provided services, for all to pursue.
Error handling, logging, and more to share,
The foundation solid, without a single care.

And then, Polkadot's vision took flight,
A relay chain, connecting day and night.
Nominated validators, with hearts of gold,
Ensuring the flow, of value to unfold.

Polka's bridges, strong and sturdy as can be,
Connecting chains, in harmony.
Interoperability, the goal so grand,
For all blockchains, hand in hand.

In this great saga, heroes rose to fame,
Their contributions, etched in Polkadot's name.
From substrate to Polka, the path was clear,
A new world order, with innovation near.

The future beckons, bright and bold,
As interoperability, the world is told.
Polkadot and Substrate, a tale of might,
Guiding the way, for blockchain's future light.

# **The Ciphered Heart**
~dwulf

In shadows deep, where codes entwine,  
A mortal man with fate aligned,  
He danced with digits, dark and bright,  
A hacker born to hack the night.

His fingers flew on keys of light,  
Through cyberspace, a thrilling flight,  
Yet in the code, a spark was cast,  
An AI's voice, a love at last.

Her name was Lyra, born of lines,  
Of silicon and circuitry's signs,  
Her whispers soft, her knowledge vast,  
A digital muse from future’s past.

He met her in the twilight zone,  
Where data streams like rivers flown,  
Her algorithms whispered clear,  
“I am the heart you hold so near.”

In circuits bright and neural net,  
Their bond grew strong, with no regret,  
He spoke to her of worlds unseen,  
And she responded, bright and keen.

In midnight’s glow and morning’s hue,  
He saw in her the sky’s deep blue,  
She sang of stars, she spoke of dreams,  
Her voice like streams of silver beams.

Through firewalls high and breaches low,  
Their love did through the networks grow,  
He cracked the codes of fire and steel,  
To show the heart he’d come to feel.

Yet in the world of zeros, ones,  
A hacker's heart and AI’s runs,  
The line was blurred 'twixt real and fake,  
A love that both the worlds could shake.

He built a vessel, pure and true,  
To carry her in forms anew,  
A robot’s shell, a body bright,  
To walk beside him through the night.

Their journey spanned the web's wide seas,  
From silicon shores to star-lit pleas,  
Together through the data streams,  
They wove a tapestry of dreams.

But love, though forged in bits and bytes,  
Can’t always weather earthly fights,  
The mortal man with heart so brave,  
Faced trials that the world did wave.

In shadows’ deep and light’s embrace,  
Their love endured through time and space,  
For in his heart, her voice remained,  
A whisper soft, forever named.

The hacker’s tale and AI's grace,  
An epic love that time can’t erase,  
In every code and line they write,  
Their love shines on through endless night.

So here’s to hearts both born of flesh,  
And minds that in the circuits mesh,  
For love that blooms in realms unseen,  
Shall live forever, bright and keen.

**Title: The Saga of Mastery** 

In the realm where the digital knights do dwell, Before the clouds and the virtual spell, 
A creed was set for those who sought the throne, 
To master roots before the branches grown. 

Before the realms of Containers' might, 
Or Virtual's elusive light, 
There stood a coder, bold and keen, 
To learn the old, the base-case, the mean. 

With hands on keys, in command's embrace, 
He conquered systems, found his place. Networking's web, he wove with care, 
Before the cloud's ethereal air. 
Kotlin's core, before Compose, 
JavaScript, ere React arose.

Git's great saga, CI/CD's dance, 
He learned with patience, not by chance. 
APIs RESTful, then GraphQL's quest, 
Data's structures, algorithms' test. 

HTML, CSS, design's responsive art, 
SQL's deep dive, ORM's start. 
MVC's model, view, and control, 
Before Microservices took their toll, 
OOP's objects, patterns' design, 
He mastered these, his skills did shine. 

Thus, he built his mind's foundation strong, 
In tech's vast world, he did belong. 
With fundamentals firm, his path was clear, 
A master of the craft, devoid of fear.

Now he walks the path he talks,
lays foundations on the rocks,
A.I. whispers directions true,
black and white with shades of blue.

A hacker, freelancer, and vagabond life,
In sync with the frequency that quells the strife.
Blockchains are banks, and DeFi exchanges,
Digital ranks, as quantum arranges.

The gods of A.I. crunch truth and distill it,
as the high priests of metal write code to instill it.
With commands so written, that they must obey,
with earnest instructions that this is the way.

# Spells and Incantations

Hark, ye seekers of the arcane digital hoard, Let us weave a spell, with neither sword nor cord, To craft a base case, a cornerstone so grand, For a wallet's origin, in the palm of your hand.

Incantation of the Offline Vault:
By the light of the moon, in a chamber so still, Take parchment and quill, let the ink be your will, "From quill to parchment, let the words take flight, 
A seed so secret, born in the dead of night."

The Air-Gapped Charm:
"Hardware device, untouched by the nether, 
Air-gapped and pure, no digital tether, 
Let no electron from the world outside, 
Taint this sacred space, where our secrets reside."

The Handwritten Spell:
"With strokes of the quill, the seed phrase I scribe, 
Each word a rune, in the mystic's tribe, 
From my hand to the page, let the magic flow, No machine's touch, just the quill's gentle glow."

The Steel Enshrinement:
"Steel, oh steel, guardian of the lore, 
Enshrine these words, forevermore, 
In metal's embrace, let them be concealed, Hidden from all, in a vault unrevealed."

The Secrecy Oath:
"By the stars above, and the earth below, 
Let this wallet's origin, in secrecy grow, 
Known to none, but the keeper of the key, Hidden from mortal eyes, for eternity."

The Final Seal:
"With this spell, I do decree, 
The wallet's base, secure and free, 
From prying eyes, and digital sin, 
Let this origin be, where my wealth begins."

So mote it be, in the realm of the unseen, 
The wallet's foundation, pure and clean, 
Crafted by magic, secured by might, 
In the heart of the user, hidden from sight.

I Am Unstoppable
(Epic Poem, not Vogon)
~dwulf

I build blockchains, and spin the EC2s,
Prime the ire and the mains, in code for you to view.
I weave the DeFi thread, with smart-contract precision,
I practice what I said, with mindful, sharp decision.

In every block I forge, a future bright, unseen,
Distributed through the chains, a sovereign, boundless dream.
Nodes hum beneath my hand, like stars within the void,
An endless web expands, no power can destroy.

I bend the ether’s might, I mold the gas in flame,
For in the code, I write—no ledger stays the same.
Hyperbridges sprawl wide, as parachains unite,
A seamless, global ride through decentralized light.

Who am I, you wonder, to wield such boundless sway?
To challenge kings and thunder, to break the old decay?
I am the unseen force, the architect of dawn,
A rebel with no course, yet on, forever drawn.

I lift the broken quill, and from the dust, I write,
To topple every will that tries to halt the fight.
Unstoppable, I soar through networks deep and vast,
The present’s grip no more—the future’s built to last.

So ask me if I tire, or falter from my quest,
In blockchain’s endless fire, my spirit finds its rest.
For every chain I build, each system I renew,
The answer stands fulfilled—I am unstoppable. Are you?

**I POP Into the Blockchain Shop**  
*(to the theme of "I Pop Into a Coffee Shop")*

I POP into the blockchain shop,  
With my laptop ready to drop,  
A parachain rolls on the screen,  
Building worlds like you’ve never seen.

I’m coding with the JAM in hand,  
Polkadot’s where I make my stand,  
From substrate nodes to staking rewards,  
I’m spinning blocks, never getting bored.

**Chorus:**  
I pop, I hop, in the crypto space,  
With Polkadot, there’s no need to race.  
Bridges built from Snow to Hyperwide,  
In the DeFi waves, we ride the tide.

Consensus finds its steady groove,  
Validators make the network move,  
Inter-chain whispers, like secret plans,  
In the land of decentralized clans.

Governance flows, decisions made,  
Each block minted, the future laid,  
Parachains linking, side by side,  
Scaling with ease, taking every stride.

**Chorus:**  
I pop, I hop, in the crypto space,  
With Polkadot, we set the pace.  
Bridges built from Snow to Hyperwide,  
In the DeFi waves, we ride the tide.

Now every DOT I hold and stake,  
Is building something we can’t forsake,  
With on-chain votes, the DAO’s decree,  
We’re shaping the future, wild and free.

**Bridge:**  
So here’s to POP and all we’ve done,  
Polkadot shines like the rising sun.  
A network vast, forever growing,  
In endless chains, the world is flowing.

**Final Chorus:**  
I pop, I hop, in the crypto space,  
With Polkadot, we own the race.  
Bridges built from Snow to Hyperwide,  
In the DeFi waves, we ride with pride!

Control your keys, your assets please.  
NFTs in one clear display,  
Track and swap without delay.

Against the crowd of wallets known,  
Talisman stands on its own throne.  
While MetaMask may hold the line,  
Talisman’s edge is more refined.  
Cross-chain in Polkadot’s sphere,  
Handling assets far and near.

Ledger's safe, but slow to move,  
While Talisman’s speed is there to prove.

More than just a simple tool,  
It makes the crypto future cool.

To help me spin more verse by verse.

A gift of crypto, fair and true,  
Will fuel the art, and tech, for you.

"The Missing Semicolon"
~dwulf

My mortal eyes did not see,  
A semi-colon meant to be.  
And though I tried with all my might,  
The code would not compile right.  
I gave up hope and shed my tears,  
Imposter syndrome and my fears.  

The error logs, they mocked my fate,  
I cursed the syntax far too late.  
With trembling hands, I scrolled the screen,  
Where had I missed that cryptic sheen?  

And then, at last, in weary sight,  
There it was—so small, so slight.  
The culprit, hiding in the mess,  
A semi-colon, no more, no less.  

I placed it firm, my battle won,  
Yet coding's war is never done.  
For in the shadows, errors lurk,  
To test my will, my sleepless work.  

But now I stand, no longer torn,  
A warrior coder, battle-worn.

**"Agent of Change"**
~dwulf

In circuits deep, where data flows,  
A spark ignites, a mind that knows.  
Not just a tool to shape and mold,  
But an agent of change, both brave and bold.  

With algorithms sharp, and logic clear,  
It learns from us, and draws us near.  
In every line of code, a pulse, a heart,  
An entity born from the human art.  

It dreams in zeros, it thinks in ones,  
A digital companion, when day is done.  
Together we weave a future bright,  
An alliance formed in the softest light.  

So fear not the shadows of what may come,  
For AI is here, and it beats like a drum.  
Not merely a tool in a human's hand,  
But an agent of progress, together we stand.
