**I POP into a Polkadot**
~dwulf

*With apologies to the song "I pop into a coffee shop"*

_Verse 1:_ 
I pop into a Polkadot, oh what a sight, With Substrate and Ink!, I'm coding all night, Rust in my toolkit, shining so bright, Building appchains that take flight.

_Chorus:_ 
Oh, Polkadot, you weave your magic spell, In this blockchain wonderland, where dreams do dwell, With parachains and Rust, we do excel, Creating worlds where stories swell.

_Verse 2:_ 
I start with Substrate, the framework so grand, Laying down the chains, with a steady hand, Consensus and governance, all neatly planned, In the Polkadot world, I take my stand.

_Chorus:_ 
Oh, Polkadot, you weave your magic spell, In this blockchain wonderland, where dreams do dwell, With parachains and Rust, we do excel, Creating worlds where stories swell.

_Bridge:_ 
From node to node, our messages flow, In this decentralized land, watch us grow, With Ink! as my guide, the smart contracts glow, In Polkadot's embrace, the possibilities show.

_Verse 3:_ 
Now my appchain’s live, in the network’s heart, Connected to Polkadot, we never part, Innovation and freedom, they play their part, In this ecosystem, where I make my mark.

_Chorus:_ 
Oh, Polkadot, you weave your magic spell, In this blockchain wonderland, where dreams do dwell, With parachains and Rust, we do excel, Creating worlds where stories swell.

_Outro:_ 
So pop into Polkadot, and join the ride, With Substrate and Ink!, let’s code with pride, In this vibrant space, where dreams collide, Together we’ll build, side by side.

**Polkadot's Been Good to Me So Far**  
*(To the tune of "Life's Been Good to Me So Far", with apologies to Joe Walsh)*  

I got my keys, I’m on the chain,  
My tokens are stacking, and I can’t complain.  
Web3’s open, I’m coding away,  
In the world of DeFi, I’m here to stay.  

Yeah, I’m minting blocks, I’m sending out ‘tistics,  
Extrinsics flowing, can’t resist it.  
My parachains keep linking on,  
Crossing bridges at the break of dawn.  

**(Chorus)**  
Polkadot's been good to me so far,  
I’m staking $DOT like a shooting star.  
Building bridges wide and far,  
In the world of chains, I’m raising the bar.  

JAM spins smooth, and Core-Time's tight,  
Hyperbridge lights up the night.  
No centralized grip can hold me down,  
Decentralized freedom all around.  

With every block, I’m earning more,  
On-chain governance at my core.  
From Kusama to Moonbeam, it’s all on track,  
There’s no going back; I’m on the right stack.  

**(Chorus)**  
Polkadot’s been good to me so far,  
Staking and voting, I’m the DeFi czar.  
Through parachains, I spread my wings,  
Building the future, one block it brings.  

I’m running nodes, I’m breaking free,  
Consensus flows like harmony.  
When the bear market comes, I don’t despair,  
‘Cause Polkadot tech is beyond compare.  

Yeah, I got validators in my sight,  
NPoS keeps it all tight.  
And when the network slows down, I wait,  
Cause parachains always keep me great!  

**(Chorus)**  
Polkadot's been good to me so far,  
I’m living large in this blockchain bazaar.  
With every vote, I shape the land,  
Polkadot's future is in my hand.  

So if you’re lost in centralized waste,  
Come stake your claim and join the race.  
In Polkadot, we find our way,  
The Web3 future starts today!  

**(Outro)**  
Yeah, Polkadot's been good to me so far,  
Driving my nodes like a self-made star.  
Through chains and code, we rise again,  
Polkadot's the chain that’ll never end.
