In the vast, often inexplicably weird cosmos, where the improbable is merely breakfast for the impossible, one finds the Slitharian birthing tree - not, as one might expect, a flora, but a marvel of genetic engineering that would make even the most seasoned botanist throw up their hands and declare a career change. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in its pursuit to provide comprehensive enlightenment on all things bizarre and galactic, offers a detailed entry on this phenomenon.

A Slitharian design, the "tree" is, in fact, a highly advanced, genetically modified fungus. Yet, calling it a fungus does it as much justice as calling the Infinite Improbability Drive a "nifty gadget". This biological masterpiece functions as an organic supercomputer, specializing in what can only be termed as molecular consciousness transfer. Over three meticulous cycles, it scans a species' entire being – yes, including that bit of soul you thought was non-transferable – and proceeds to create a humanoid clone, replete with memories, personality quirks, and that embarrassing moment from their adolescence they hoped was forgotten.  The original corpus (alive or dead), is dissolved and reconstructed into a series 13 clone.

However, it's worth noting, particularly for those considering a post-mortem career in cloning, that these humanoid replicas, known as Series 13 clones, come with a default setting: female. This isn't a matter of Slitharian preference but rather a pragmatic solution to the pesky instability of the Y chromosome. Those originally of the XY persuasion might find themselves in need of a slight neuronal realignment post-production – a small price to pay for a fresh start in a new, albeit cloned, body.

The Series 13 clones are a testament to the birthing tree's prowess. They're not immortal – the Slitharians haven't cracked that code yet, or if they have, they're not telling. But what these clones lack in eternal life, they make up for with accelerated regeneration capabilities, making them quite handy to have around in case of accidents or intergalactic skirmishes.

As for the tree itself, it stands as a majestic testament to Slitharian ingenuity, a living, breathing bio-computer that blurs the lines between technology and nature. Its existence raises philosophical questions about life, identity, and the ethics of clone manufacturing that would undoubtedly give pause to even the most adventurous of galactic hitchhikers.

So, if you ever find yourself wandering the galaxy, in search of a new beginning or perhaps just curious about the limits of Slitharian biotechnology, consider a visit to the birthing tree. Just remember, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy advises bringing along a good therapist for the post-transfer identity crisis – and, as always, don't forget your towel.


# Tree Proceedure

The Slitharian birthing tree, has a process that begins when the original host, seeking a new existence or escape from the confines of their biological imperfections, approaches or is placed into the birthing tree through what appears to be resembling nothing so much as a piece of high art, features an opening uncannily similar to a female vagina, though it serves a purpose far removed from any natural reproductive process known to Earthly or most alien biologists.

As the original host slips through this opening, they are not entering a passage of birth in the traditional sense but one of rebirth. The tree's interior functions anesthetize the host as a complex bio-computer, scanning the host's corpus in three comprehensive cycles. It is not known how exactly but the biocomputer  captures, in a quantum array of photon waves what might be colloquially referred to as the "soul" of the individual, ensuring that the essence of the person – their memories, personality, and consciousness – is preserved intact through the transition.

In a process that is equal parts disturbing and awe-inspiring, the original bio-organic corpus is dissolved. Yet, from this dissolution springs new life; a beautiful, female humanoid clone is meticulously constructed within the fungal matrix of the tree. This being, known as a Series 13 clone, emerges fully formed, an adult female with a completely denuded body in appearance and cognition but birthed from the tree without an umbilical cord, and thus, lacking a belly button.  Head hair will grow out, but never facial hair (except optical areas like eye bows and eyelashes). - a detail that underscores their artificial origin.

Series 13 clones are invariably female, a default setting attributed to the complexities and instabilities associated with replicating the Y chromosome in the lab. As such, men undergoing the process will find themselves not just in a new body, but a new physical and genetic sex. Initially, male minds retain their male psychological characteristics, leading to a period of intense adjustment over the course of 28 days. Sexual orientations and gender may shift; heterosexual men brought through this have a 70% chance just to become lesbians, 20% bissexual and 10% a straight woman as they acclimate to their new physical and genetic makeup.

Another anomaly for the post-transfer period of a male to a series 13 clone is marked by a necessary neuro alignment, a process taking roughly 28 days, culminating in the clone experiencing their first menstrual period. Additionally, during the 28 day adjustment, male to 13 series individuals report phantom sensations of their previous sex organs, a curious side effect of the consciousness transfer of an anatomical male into a series 13 clone.

The birthing tree, with its blend of the organic and the technological, represents a pinnacle of Slitharian achievement in genetic engineering. Series 13 clones, living testaments to this achievement, navigate the complexities of their existence, embodying both the continuity of identity and the profound changes inherent in their rebirth.

# Journal of Derrick, first person account of being reborn through the Birthing Tree

I slid through the exit of the birthing tree, through a slime placenta membrane, as Slitharian handlers assisted me, my mind was unable to control my body as I felt disconnected from my limbs even my vision was blurry.  I was told that this was normal, I was told, the mapping of a XY brain of my old body now mapped to a XX body of the series 13 clone, my male body needed to re-attune to the body I was in, my vision still blurry and I still could not stand up without the Slitharian handlers.

"The neuro mapping is delayed to you, do not panic.  Your original corpus was male the nanites will take time to train your new neural maps.  You where not originally born as female, your brain is a product of a male body.  As such it will take time to orient to your new corpus", I could see my arms and hands but they were limp, like the rest of my body.

Narrator:
This is a side effect of the Birthing Tree, when genetic males of the human 
species are rendered as a genetic female.  There is a period of neural misalignment, causing nausea, feeling of drunkenness, or being dislocated from the body, these effects last no longer than a week and in most cases in 24 hours.

Genetic females do not suffer as much, often a complete alignment is done in less than a week.
Narrator:

I could feel myself being put upon the medbed for recovery.  I fell into a deep sleep, and dreamed of myself, my original self, one last time as I gazed into the reflected stream was the woman of my dreams, a woman than was me.

Despite the disorientation my vision cleared after a good nights rest, my body was now for the most part aligned, it felt different, very new, but I could still feel.

I could see my hands, delicate and feminine.  It was only a matter of time when I gazed upon my bussom, women's breasts and my hands went to explore my neither regions, which felt weird, my fingers felt a vagina, but my brain felt my old member, but my eyes and fingers told a different story, I was definitely female.

I was clothed in a white hospital gown, my body was completely denuded with the exception of my eye lashes, eye brows, and head hair, which grew several inches each hour.

I still felt like me, mentally, I could remember everything up to being inserted into the tree of birthing.

My body was different, but the annoying phantom appendage was something I could still feel between my legs, but every time I looked and felt with my hands, it felt very different.


Narriator:
On ancient earth, there were men that went to surgery to cosmetically, not functionally change their secondary sexual characteristics, sections of skin were cut from the host, to create a very artificial appendage, with adhoc bio-mapping to approximations of atomically correct processes.

The birthing tree, scans. deconstructs, then reconstructs the corpus for the host, the end product is a XX Series 13 clone, the corpus is always female, because of the stability issues with the Y chromosome.

Males who go through the process will have their sex changed on a chromosomal level and have 2 XX genetic female profile.





The nurse, A.I. agent was attentive to me, answering my questions in a soulless and mechanical manner.
