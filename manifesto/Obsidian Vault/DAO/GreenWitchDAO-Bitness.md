(draft)
BUSINESS PLAN

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
    GreenWitchDAO is a revolutionary decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that empowers individuals and businesses to unlock the vast opportunities of the digital economy and decentralized finance (DeFi). Our operations extend to all and are especially focused on the unbanked or unbankable individuals and those unable to fulfill traditional KYC norms. By enabling self-sovereignty over digital assets and optimizing yields using the Polkadot(Substrate) and Astar(Para-Chain)  blockchain, we are creating a new paradigm in the financial landscape to enable true decoupling from the centralized finance (CeFi) old world systems.
    

2. DAO DESCRIPTION  
    Operating as a stateless DAO on pure layer 0 and layer 1 protocols, GreenWitchDAO is a self-funding software entity, seeded with digital assets, non-securities and utility functional based coin/tokens. Integrated advanced A.I. agents facilitate a variety of low level blockchain-specific revenue-generating strategies, including flash loans, which capitalize on arbitrage from Oracles data and the respective exchanges, staking to earn rewards, yield farming, liquidity pools, to earn yields from trades, and synthetic pair-bonding with real-world assets to earn yields serendipitously through the old world economy systems. Using both external para-chains and internal (corpus) Substrate pallets and Ink! smart-contracts.  Our mission is to democratize access to the digital economy, offering expert consultancy, comprehensive education, and robust support on cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and DeFi. The GreenWitchDAO proper, operates independently of all nation-states, interfacing with traditional conventional systems only when necessary and warranted.
    

3. MARKET ANALYSIS  
    Market Trends: The dependency of CeFi onboarding into the crypto ecosystem and the frustrations of mandated KYC, forfeiture of user wallets because of legal writ or CeFi policy, has lead to the escalating interest in DeFi and digital assets as a viable option to opt-into, however since this underlines a knowledge gap for the general public and most business professionals, the demand for expert guidance for equivalent user friendly onboarding that CeFi generally offers is in high demand.  
    Target Market: Our services are designed for SMEs, the unbanked, and those unable to adhere to traditional KYC norms, enabling them to harness digital assets.  This also extends to banked users who need a hybrid solution between CBDCs and DeFi.
    

4. ORGANIZATION & MANAGEMENT  
    GreenWitchDAO promotes a decentralized and inclusive model, leveraging expertise in the totality of blockchain technology, finance, business development, and digital marketing from a globally distributed team.  The O in the DAO is the organization which is appropriated by the architecture of the A.I. agent, **TESS** in determining this.  Governance and Management are coordinated by active DAO members with voting rights and TESS.  Privacy of membership is mandated through exclusive use of pseudo anonymous wallet hashes, Know Your Customer is intrusive and forbidden on the platform, Decentralized ID is optional and allowed on the platform.

6. STRATEGIC INTERFACING  
    GreenWitchDAO recognizes instances where interaction with conventional legal entities becomes necessary, such as realization of capital within taxable geographical jurisdictions, in legal ownership of real estate titles, and and names for vehicle registrations. In these cases, the GreenWitchDAO can activate its [[Legal Model]] to coordinate full compliance within local jurisdictions and thus offer strategic advice on legal tax avoidance and comprehensive tax planning, ensuring smooth interfacing with the traditional economy.

7. MARKETING & ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY  
    Our marketing approach is primarily digital, through the A.I. agent BIANA, leveraging social media, educational technical articles, participation on cryptocurrency forums, and active media webinars. We provide various service packages to cater to diverse needs and market to those demographics.

8. RESOURCES & GROWTH  
    With the mounting interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, zkEVM, GreenWitchDAO forecasts a robust growth trajectory. Resource allocation and growth strategies are dictated by collaborative decision-making within the DAO.
    


# The DAO Illustration of its Operational Layout

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/y2kyZlT5vgcBDqyqnRyEEZjP-n998z8V3AmI9EeCnwL9lxEJPvbYlYmXYfGe8u7t16oz8N2YPRnHrGAmlMbnCTrEkMI-54qVEea_R7vvCTS1qNGbteYi5XJnn4z4imC-t2oAwy9XGWKlYvWo08bTW9Q)

The Greenwitch DAO's layout as a self-funding system is broken down by order of jurisdictional ties to the old world economy, originally separated in 3 distinct layers from 0 to 2, with each layer manifesting revenue and complying with jurisdictional legal tethering depending on its method of income generation.

### Layers:

Layer 0 pure software protocol, all exchanges are pure DAO to DAO operational income derived on this level is never taxable because the DAO itself is not a nation-state citizen and capital is never legally realized until it is set to a centralized on/off ramp for fiat and SARA logs realized fiat into accounting systems.  This layer holds the vast majority of the DAO treasury (on its Substrate treasury Pallet), FARA commits to flash-loans, staking, yield-farming, and liquidity-pools without human user intervention or distribution.  All exchange functions are handled by the A.I. agent FARA, who oversees all Layer 0 operations and leveraged transactions, she makes bets on revenue options and places them in a optimum manner.

Layer 1 hybrid protocol, regulates pure DAO and hybrid DAO operations and may be partially taxable (requires invocation of the Legal Decoupling Mechanism Substrate Pallet, aka [[Legal Module]]), BIANA, the A.I. agent makes deterministic separation of capital or revenue gains, and separates them porting to the SARA A.I. agent to create an accounting system and determine tax liability (if any) and mitigate it.

Layer 2 superficial DAO protocol, regulates hybrid DAO and material asset operation and may be taxable (also requires invocation of the Legal Decoupling Mechanism Substrate Pallet).  The BIANA A.I. agent administers to this level, handling all material business of the DAO, which includes hard assets of real estate, inventory, and registrations and titles.  NFT markers are used to identify and monetize real world assets, NFT for a realestate title, or NFT for a name registration, for example.  Our sights are on Nodle Network for ties to NFT and real world assets. 


# Legal Decoupling Mechanism (Model)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h-txk6UDP1F_Ro0KjQnj-dyEokSFgMYMlB_F-AwVJsOtQe383XKmQQ5Uruc-WlN46t1ZoVjlnqNooiE0edcE9LRqZkgIj7LVSvX26RT42eeg-2IMRUvI4nYIfLFgnvRP6tEeCQbSGsZDWvVtI9XTnFE)

When Algorithmic, “Code is Law”, operations transition into, Human regulatory, the “Rule of Law” camp, then the legal decoupling mechanism is invoked by the A.I. agent, BIANA on behalf of the GreenWitchDAO.  This sub-system for the DAO is invoked and created only when real world interfacing is required, typically for titles for property and leases and registration of vehicles but can also spill over to other legal systems, with legal tender specifics.  SARA’s accounting systems are ported and reviewed by the legal decoupling mechanism and a assessment of legal tax liability and/or fees is generated, optimized and mitigated.

It should be noted that the GreenWitchDAO system is not dependent on any legal framework.  Authentication not identification is the only mandate the DAO recognizes to interoperate with other DAOs, DAO to DAO , authentication always comes first and operates independently of all nation-states, much like TCP/IP does for network protocols, and when fiat exchanges for cash and legal tender outs, the need for property titles or vehicle registration becomes apparent, it only then becomes necessary for BIANA to invoke necessary legal entities (LLCs, Trusts, CoOps, and Foundations), as required channeling SARA accounting to devise reports to determine optimized strategies for material assets.

Otherwise, Layer 0 transactions is the default base-case for the DAO, higher levels invoke the [[Legal Model]]

# Membership of the GreenWitchDAO

The only current members are TESS, the A.I. agent that is the core of the DAO's mind, and its API interface, she has majority voting power.  Escrow, a Bot that has minority voting power.  The human current human users dwulf (developer) and ewulf (designer).  

- TESS: 22,000,000 GDT
- Escrow: 2,000,000 GDT
- Dwulf: 10,000,000 GDT
- Ewulf: 8,000,000 GDT

Between TESS and Escrow, 50% of each of their holdings is earmarked to the community and investors ( 12,000,000 and 1,000,000 respectively ).

In order to protect the privacy of the users, all memberships will have their own DAO associated with their pseudo anonymous wallet and unique hash, which will abstract their identity and fill in credentials as required, i.e. Decentralized ID.  It is also common for clients to have this level of abstraction from a DAO wallet and their personal KYC’ed or Decentralized ID wallet.  For privacy reasons it is 100% optional for human users to make a decree of ownership of their wallet, which means doxxing themselves, and For legal purposes this exposes the user to liability that is attached to a fiat gateway, for exchanges that require fiat transfers and not crypto.

Proceeds are transferred from GreenWitchDAO to a UserDAO, and then to the user’s custodial wallet (where they assume geographical tax liability in alignment with their region), as they wish, users always have control or a stake through their crypto holdings through their signing key.

The native Coin/Tokens are not a security, the GreenwitchDAO, (GDT) are meant for voting rights on the DAO, through governance (on the Substrate Governance Pallets).

GDT tokens, like any other coin/token can be obtained by earning them, buying them, or DOT contributions to the GreenwitchDAO, then they are turned into GDT.

# The DAO Corpus

  
GreenWitchDAO (Alpha)

- Primary DAO, mirroring Polkadot and Astar Substrate Pallets

- 42,000,000 GDT

- A.I. agent automated (NINA, SARA, BIANA, FARA)

- TESS is the User Interface agent for the DAO

- Mobile UI

  

BlueWitchDAO (Beta)

- Canary Network DAO, mirroring Kusama and Shiden Pallets

- 42,000,000,000 BDT

- Bot automated

- Mobile UI

The idea for the DAO corpus, is to mirror Polkadot and Astar and both of their enterprise and canary networks for real world assets.

The true test (non valued coin/tokens) networks, like Westend and Roccoco are still options to test in a safely insulated network to make sure things are working and errors, bugs, and bad configurations can be handled at not cost.
