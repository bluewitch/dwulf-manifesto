Motivation
- DHT latencies won't get us to CDN performance - unpredictable hops
- The amount of content in our DHTs isn't that big
- Federated 'super nodes' with a full copy of the DHT
- Federation here means 'eventually consistent'
- System optimized for larger, stabler nodes that a normal DHT
- 5 instances / 3 orgs
- ~60TB primary datastore
- ~100ms p95 response time
- No major outages over the past 2 years of operation.
- SUpport for Ethereum Attestation Service, other searches
- Generalized "decentralized Key-Value store"
