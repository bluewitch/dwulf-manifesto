Substrate is a framework for building blockchains, designed to be flexible, modular, and future-proof. It's like the LEGO of the blockchain world, allowing developers to build custom blockchains by snapping together different components.

At the heart of Substrate are two main layers: the outer node and the runtime. The outer node handles network communication, manages transaction requests, and deals with consensus. It's like the conductor of the blockchain orchestra, making sure all the instruments (or in this case, nodes) are playing in harmony.

The runtime, on the other hand, is where the magic happens. It's responsible for the on-chain logic, such as managing the state of the blockchain and executing transactions. It's like the composer of the blockchain symphony, creating the rules and logic that govern the entire system.

Now, let's talk about running chains. Substrate-based chains can be connected to Polkadot, a layer-0 protocol and multichain network. This connection allows for seamless interoperability, meaning different blockchains can communicate and share information with each other. It's like having a universal translator for blockchains, making it easier for them to work together.

To build and run a Substrate-based chain, you could follow a series of tutorials that guide you through the process. These tutorials cover everything from setting up a local development environment to simulating a network and authorizing specific nodes. It's like a blockchain boot camp, teaching you the ins and outs of Substrate and how to build your own chain.

Yeah, you could do that.  But lets be real, who has time for that?

Tanssi, has perfected the onboarding for developers and business enterprises to build EVM, Substrate, or other chains.

Also POP cli, a command line interface for your own Substrate chain.

Like I said, Substrate is a powerful framework for building custom blockchains, with a modular architecture that separates the outer node and runtime. By connecting to Polkadot, Substrate-based chains can achieve seamless interoperability with other blockchains. And with a series of tutorials to guide you, building and running your own Substrate-based chain is certainly within reach, the learning exercise is good but sometimes overwhelming, I prefer Tanssi for polished Substrate chains and POP cli for testing on Substrate.

# JAM Interplay

Let's dive into the exciting world of JAM, Polkadot, and Substrate, and how they all work together to create a more efficient and versatile blockchain ecosystem.

JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) is a proposed evolution of Polkadot's relay chain, designed to be more modular and efficient. It aims to replace the current relay chain with a more minimalistic design, allowing for a permissionless object environment similar to Ethereum's smart contract environment. This means that JAM will enable Polkadot to run generic "services" that can process the results of execution on cores, much like smart contract logic.

Substrate, on the other hand, is a framework for building blockchains. It's like the LEGO of the blockchain world, allowing developers to snap together different components to create custom blockchains. This makes it easier for developers to build their own chains without having to start from scratch.

The interplay between JAM, Polkadot, and Substrate is quite interesting. JAM will incorporate a parachains service that can run existing parachains built on the Substrate blockchain framework. This means that developers can still use Substrate to develop and deploy their own blockchains, but they'll be running on top of the new JAM architecture.

This integration of JAM and Substrate will allow for a more efficient and versatile blockchain ecosystem. Developers can continue to use Substrate to build their own chains, while benefiting from the improved performance and capabilities of the JAM architecture.

I agree that JAM is a proposed evolution of Polkadot's relay chain, designed to be more modular and efficient. Substrate is a framework for building blockchains. The interplay between the two allows developers to continue using Substrate to build their own chains, while benefiting from the improved performance and capabilities of the JAM architecture. It's like a match made in blockchain heaven!

## Leveraging JAM for Strategic Business in Polkadot: Insights from a Substrate Rust Developer

### Introduction

As a seasoned Substrate Rust developer, the evolution of Polkadot from its inception to the groundbreaking JAM protocol represents not just a technological advancement but a lucrative business opportunity. The transition from Polkadot 1 to Polkadot 2 and the introduction of JAM offers unprecedented flexibility and scalability. This article will delve into the technical nuances of JAM and explore how developers and entrepreneurs can capitalize on these advancements, particularly in the mercantile business of buying and selling $DOT and supplying $DOT fuel for future chains on Polkadot's cores.

### Technical Background

To understand and leverage JAM, it's essential to grasp:

- **Blockchain as a state-transition function**
- **State concepts and transitions**
- **Economic security and proof-of-stake mechanisms**

### Recap: Polkadot 1

**Social Innovations:**
- Polkadot operates as a massive DAO with on-chain governance and fork-less runtime upgrades.
- DOT is classified as software by the SEC, distinguishing it from securities.
- Development is driven by the decentralized Polkadot Fellowship.

**Technological Innovations:**
- Polkadot 1 introduced shared security and sharded execution.
- The platform uses a WASM-based meta-protocol, enabling fork-less upgrades and heterogeneous sharding.

### Sharded Execution: Core Concepts

Polkadot's sharded execution model, akin to a multi-core CPU, ensures scalability and security. A subset of validators re-execute L2 blocks using ELVES, ensuring high security through multiple validation rounds. This "Pessimistic Rollup" approach differentiates Polkadot from traditional monolithic blockchains, allowing parallel processing across different cores.

### Heterogeneous Sharding

Polkadot’s approach to heterogeneous sharding allows unique application-specific shards, initially using WASM. With JAM, this capability is enhanced through PVM/RISC-V, providing more robust and flexible shard configurations.

### Polkadot 2: Agile Coretime

Polkadot 2 introduces "agile coretime," allowing flexible core rentals from a single block to a month. This flexibility supports a diverse range of use cases, from large enterprises to smaller teams, making resource allocation more dynamic.

### Understanding In-Core vs. On-Chain Execution

**In-core execution:** 
- Conducted within a subset of validators (core).
- Scalable and secure through ELVES, optimizing resource usage.

**On-chain execution:** 
- Involves all validators, ensuring high security but at higher resource costs.

### Introducing JAM

JAM builds on Polkadot 2, providing even greater flexibility with programmable in-core and on-chain work. It allows for arbitrary data read/write access to the Data Availability (DA) layer, enhancing the functionality of cores.

### Terminology: Services and Work Items

In JAM, L2/Parachains become "Services," and blocks/transactions are "Work-Items" or "Work-Packages." Services have entry points like `fn refine()` (in-core) and `fn accumulate()` (on-chain), leading to the term JAM—Join Accumulate Machine.

### Semi-Coherence in JAM

JAM introduces semi-coherence, enabling frequently interacting services to create coherent environments dynamically while maintaining overall system flexibility. This balances the scalability of asynchronous systems with the programmability of synchronous ones.

### CorePlay and PVM

CorePlay utilizes JAM's flexibility for a scalable smart contract environment. It allows actor-based smart contracts to run on JAM cores, leveraging PVM's efficient metering and ability to pause and resume execution.

### Business Opportunities in Polkadot Ecosystem

#### Buying and Selling $DOT

The dynamic and flexible nature of JAM creates lucrative opportunities in the mercantile business of $DOT. As a developer, you can:

- **Speculate on $DOT**: Use market analysis and trading algorithms to buy low and sell high, capitalizing on the volatility and demand fluctuations.
- **Supply $DOT fuel**: Provide $DOT liquidity to developers and businesses looking to deploy and operate services on Polkadot's cores.

#### Running Validator Nodes

Running a validator node on Polkadot offers continuous revenue through staking rewards. With JAM, validators play a crucial role in in-core and on-chain execution, ensuring the system's scalability and security.

#### Developing and Deploying Services

Leverage your Substrate Rust expertise to develop innovative services using JAM. By offering unique, high-demand services, you can generate revenue through service fees and transaction costs.
