Metamask is a software module for forefox or chrome, EVM wallet.  I consider it a warm wallet, between hot and cold, where a hot wallet's private key is shared with the exchange to impliment trades for crypto and a cold wallet is off-line air-gapped, and enshrined in steel.

MetaMask is as safe as your system is or the system you are on.  If you run a tight ship or if you own the system you are on then your wallet is reasonably safe, all bets are off if attacker has physical connection to your device, of course.
