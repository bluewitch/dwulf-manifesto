Creating a preimage on the Polkadot blockchain involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide broken down into simple, non-technical language:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Go to Polkadot.js Apps
1. **Open Your Browser**: Go to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps).
2. **Connect to the Correct Network**: Ensure you are connected to the Polkadot network. This can usually be done by checking the top left of the screen where the network name is displayed.

#### Step 2: Access the Developer Section
1. **Find the Developer Menu**: On the left side of the screen, you will see a list of options. Click on "Developer" to expand this menu.
2. **Select Extrinsics**: Within the Developer menu, click on "Extrinsics". This is where you can create and send different types of transactions.

#### Step 3: Prepare the Preimage Extrinsic
1. **Select Your Account**: In the section called "submit the following extrinsic", you'll see a dropdown menu for "Account". Select the account you want to use for this transaction.
2. **Choose the Extrinsic**: In the next dropdown menu labeled "Extrinsic", you need to select `preimage` and then `notePreimage`.

#### Step 4: Get the Bytes Data
1. **Encoded Call Data**: From the previous steps (where you prepared the preimage on the relay chain), you should have some encoded data. This is a long string of numbers and letters that represents the preimage.
2. **Copy the Data**: Make sure you have this encoded call data copied to your clipboard.

#### Step 5: Enter the Bytes Data
1. **Paste the Data**: In the field that appears when you select `notePreimage`, paste the encoded call data (the long string of numbers and letters).

#### Step 6: Submit the Transaction
1. **Check Your Balance**: Ensure your account has enough funds. You need a bit of DOT (Polkadot's cryptocurrency) to cover the transaction fees and a deposit.
2. **Submit**: Click on "Submit Transaction". You may be prompted to confirm this transaction through your wallet (like the Polkadot.js extension).

#### Step 7: Verify the Preimage
1. **Navigate to Governance Section**: After submitting, go back to the left-hand menu and click on "Governance".
2. **Find Preimages**: Click on "Preimages". Here you will see a list of preimages.
3. **Locate Your Preimage**: Find the one you just submitted. It should display information like the hash and length of the preimage.

### Example of What You'll Do:
- **Account Selection**: Choose your account from a dropdown menu.
- **Extrinsic Selection**: Select `preimage` -> `notePreimage`.
- **Bytes Field**: Paste the long string of encoded call data into the provided field.
- **Submit**: Click the submit button and confirm through your wallet.

### Additional Tips:
- **Sufficient Funds**: Make sure you have enough DOT in your account to cover any fees.
- **Correct Network**: Ensure you are on the right network (Polkadot, not Kusama or any other).

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully create a `Preimage::notePreimage(bytes)` extrinsic on Polkadot.js. This process allows you to propose and later submit changes to the blockchain in a structured and verifiable manner.
