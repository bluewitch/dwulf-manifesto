Decentralized Exchanges, or DeFi systems are the correct mechanisms for exchanging crypto assets.  They compete with centralized regulated exchanges that typically have more streamlined methods of fiat on/off ramps because of their centralized nature and alliances with regulatory bodies.

Fiat on/off ramps are a major sticking point with crypto (how you get the money out), and that is what gives centralized regulated exchanges the staying power to compete with DeFi.

To be clear, there are systems in place that will allow no-KYC and full DeFi on/off ramps for fiat, but they are involved and can require technical proficiency to operate correctly.

# The Decentralized Fiat Highway

#### Bisq
Bisq, is one such option and the only one I have seen that makes a true trustless trade fiat for crypto and crypto for fiat.  Bisq has a escrow system and initially requires BTC to hold in escrow until the transaction is complete on both sides, then the escrowed BTC will release to the respective users maker and taker.

#### Meetup Events
Peer-to-Peer parties at a public venue can allow for direct trades, in person.  User Alice has crypto and wants to sell it, Bob has fiat cash and wants to buy some crypto from Alice.  To determine the current price, they both look up coin gecko to see the current price for the crypto, Bob has $100 USD and buys the fraction of satoshis, for BTC that a $100 USD bill can buy.

Bob puts the $100 bill on the table and Alice sends $100 worth of her BTC to Bob's Bitcoin Wallet, both grab a cup of coffee and wait for the transaction to settle in 10 minutes.  When the BTC appears in Bob's crypto wallet, Alice takes the $100 and puts it in her purse.

#### BTC ATMs
Some BTC ATMs also allow for non-KYC transactions without a centralized exchange intermediary.

# Optimized Exchanges

It could be argued that, eventually Blockchain wallet holders will eventually find Vendors and Merchants that are more willing to acquiesces to payments and payouts though crypto exclusively.

For the wallet holder this will eliminate the need to require a on/off ramp for fiat currency in the first place.  Many hold outs to fiat are typically utilities, rent/mortgages, car loans, and conventional debit/credit card point of sale POS systems at most convince stores.

Giftcards are a option to use in lieu of fiat, since fiat at some point was used to pay for the value of the gift card, some site have been set up in such a way where they receive you crypto, and they give you a giftcard amount, sometimes at a % discount just for using crypto.
