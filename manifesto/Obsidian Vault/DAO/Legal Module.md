Every DAO requires a method to interoperate in the [[Old World Economy]].  Since nation-state Legal systems seek liability or those that can be blamed or sued if business is not well crafted with solid human contracts and Taxation systems seek citizens with taxable liability on assets owned in their christian name.   

As a result of a disagreement with either the legal system or the tax system, between 2 parties or 1 party and the nation-state, in the old world economy, courts are usually the place to resolve them, but in the new world economy, smart-contracts are implemented to fill this purpose.

The Legal Module is an attempt to fill that gap for a DAO.  Executing and rendering the API for Web2 and old world economy, conventional legal contracts warranted and enforced by the nation-state.

The DAO itself is modular, by design, and so is the Legal Module.  Assets of the DAO are held in 3 levels of capital realization. The DAO Treasury base is on Level 0 and Vault is Level 2 and depending which hash entity user receives the DAO assets will determine the taxable liability to the nation-state.

By the book, users and "owners" of a crypto wallet would be a human citizen with a doxed KYC crypto wallet identifying themselves to the nation-state will be liable for taxes; a A.I. agent non-citizen of any nation-state, with a pseudo anonymous crypto wallet hash and with no doxed identity can operate tax free unimpeded by rule of law.    

Level 0 (base case)
A level 0 system is only governed by its in-born software Substrate pallets, enabling the DAO to exchange coin/tokens (including its own), pair coin/tokens and grift fees from the exchange of coin/token pairs, to be put into the Treasury.  Or facilitate flash-loans, to borrow coin/tokens and arbitrage them through Oracles and coordinated through **FARA**, and payback the loan within the block cycle, or run yield farming campaigns either within itself or other DAOs (Bifrost, Hydration, Astar, Acala, etc.).

Level 1 (separation of church and state)
Level 1 of the DAO sorts out centralized, doxed  and decentralized not doxed assets, categorizes them and routes them;  decentralized assets are routed back to the level 0 Treasury and re-compounded in the the investment pools.  Centralized assets are routed to level 2 and is dispatched to the A.I. agent SARA, who keeps the books of the asset porting the data to and from accounting software APIs, and BIANA, who instantiates and coordinates the legal framework for the coin/token asset and mitigate the tax liability for the doxxed, nation-state slave human user.  Both SARA and BIANA work in tandem, each optimizing the other.

BIANA will implement a optimized legal framework (i.e., LLC, Trust, Foundation, CoOp, etc.) and coordinate the role of members/officers as warranted or elected upon through the governance Substrate Pallet, and SARA will optimize the books, leveraging depreciating assets, and minimizing tax liability.  Crunching the numbers, so the coin/token asset maintains its value and the highest price point possible. 

Level 2 (legal tender capital)
Level 2 assets are often real world assets that need to have a legal name for a registration of a vehicle or lease contract of a building or land.  This can also extend to real world inventory in a warehouse or brick and mortar business.  Assets are often represented as NFT hashes pair-bonded to a legal title or a registration or even real inventory.  Level 2 operations are the least desirable for the DAO, as they include real world inter-operations which inhibit the efficiency of the DAO revenue generating operations.

# DAO is independent

It is important to note that the Legal Module is only a component of the DAO, and not the DAO itself, the DAO is independent of all nation-states and has no citizenship or tax obligation to any nation-state.  Because of this the DAO does not require a Legal Module to facilitate its software operations since software does not *require* legal tethering to the old world economy.

The DAO can easily (and preferably) operate independently of the Legal Module, and this is coordinated by way of its A.I. agents that guide and direct the DAO, SARA and BIANA respectively.

The DAO allows users and A.I. agents with pseudo anonymous crypto wallets created to interoperate with the DAO without interference with the nation-state or regulatory bodies.  The DAO and its agents do not distinguish between a pseudo anonymous crypto wallet owned/operated by a human or a machine user, it only identifies the hash.

When the need for fiat is required by a human user and citizen of any given nation-state and that human user chooses to dox themselves, then BIANA coordinates the legal proceedings and handles the trade exchange of crypto to fiat.  

This can handle like any other Human Resource operation, in the case of W2 employee or a expense for a 1099 contractor and only if they insist on fiat as a form of payment.  Peer-to-peer and DAO-to-DAO operations do not have that constraint.
