Shifting entirely from centralized financial systems to a fully decentralized financial ecosystems is a significant undertaking but a necessary one. The centralized fiduciary markets are utterly corrupt and cannot and should not be trusted under any circumstances.  It is true that now instead of counter-party risk to human agents, counter-risk shifts to the algorithm programmatic agents where code is law.

Portal-ling the crux of your finances through a DeFi system involves a deep understanding of decentralized technologies beginning with the actual Blockchain itself, which under lays all of the ideas behind the decentralization ledger, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), build from this starting point and from there, introduces a broader spectrum of opportunity.   

This includes clever options through programming smart contracts and even custom Substrate software pallets which enable a step up from the conventional registry configuration of BTC Bitcoin Network and into full scale EVM and Polkadot networks with their own sub-networks and para-chains that can become quite powerful  and, let us not forget the corpus for the DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) which bring it all together through a community. Here are the steps you'd need to follow:

### 1. Educate Yourself

- **Understand Blockchain and Cryptocurrency**Learn the basics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.  Read the Bitcoin 10 page white paper, and do the same with Ethereum whitepaper and the Polkadot yellow paper.
- **Explore DeFi Platforms**: Familiarize yourself with various DeFi platforms and services.  Layers 0 (Polkadot), layer 1 (Polkadot's Para-chain)
- **Learn About DAOs**: Understand how DAOs operate and how they can be used for decentralized governance and income generation.

### 2. Set Up a Digital Wallet

- **Choose a Wallet**: Select a reputable and secure digital wallet that supports various cryptocurrencies and DeFi interactions.  My personal spread is Trust Wallet, a Binance wallet that holds my BTC, Nova Wallet, a Polkadot wallet that holds various alt-coins, Metamask, a browser based Wallet that coordinates my ETH holdings and Cosmos Wallet for other EVMs
- **Secure Your Wallet**: Your first wallet should be a air gaped, hardware wallet, or at least a mnemonic metal etching, on crypto steel.  Also use strong initial security measures like two-factor authentication and keep your private keys secure.

### 3. Convert Your Fiat Currency to Cryptocurrency

- **Use Crypto Exchanges**: Convert your existing fiat currency to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins.  This may seem extreme, but conversion of wealth into a protected cryptographic hash that only you have the signing keys to is the first corner-stone step to prevent counter party risk.

### 4. Start Using DeFi Platforms

- **Liquidity and Yield Farming/Staking**: Participate in liquidity pools or yield farming to earn returns on your HODL crypto assets.
- **Lending and Borrowing**: Use DeFi platforms for crypto lending and borrowing.

### 5. Earn Income through DAOs

- **Join a DAO**: Find and join DAOs that align with your skills and interests.
- **Contribute and Earn**: Contribute to the DAO's projects or governance and earn income in the form of tokens or cryptocurrencies.
- **Just Build It:** Spin up your own chain, test it on the test nets and participate in dApp programs like Astar Builder's Program.

### 6. Manage and Grow Your Crypto Assets

- **Diversify Your Portfolio**: Diversify your investments across different cryptocurrencies and DeFi products and real world assets tethered to crypto coin/tokens/NFTs.
- **Staking**: Consider staking your crypto to earn rewards on other platforms, get rewarded for stabilizing the network.

### 7. Everyday Transactions and Bill Payments

- **Debit Cards**: Obtain a crypto debit card for everyday transactions.

### 8. Stay Informed and Compliant

- **Legal Compliance**: Stay informed about the legal and tax implications of your crypto activities in your jurisdiction.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with the latest developments in blockchain, DeFi, and DAOs.

### 9. Emergency Planning

- **Scams and Security**: Be vigilant about scams and prioritize the security of your digital assets.
- **Technical Knowledge**: Some level of technical knowledge is required to navigate DeFi and DAO platforms safely and effectively.

### Conclusion:

Becoming your own bank using DeFi and blockchain is an ambitious goal that requires continuous learning, careful planning, and active engagement with the cryptocurrency and DeFi community. It's important to approach this transition methodically and cautiously to ensure the security of your assets and compliance with regulatory requirements.
