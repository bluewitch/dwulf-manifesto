### Summary


This proposal seeks funding from the Polkadot Treasury to launch and expand a comprehensive campaign in the U.S. focused on Business Development (BizDev) and Developer Relations (DevRel), alongside setting up a sustainable infrastructure through the deployment of JAM Toasters (hardware assets) and the integration of Core-Time Mercantile (soft-ware assets). Core-Time Mercantile involves the strategic buying and selling of Polkadot JAM core-time to power chains spun up using Tanssi, a sister-chain of Polkadot, that streamlines building other chains (EVM, Substrate, Other), creating a sustainable revenue source to fuel our BizDev and DevRel white-labeling and Blockchain consulting initiatives.

The combination of BizDev outreach, developer engagement, and infrastructure deployment not only aims to increase Polkadot’s adoption in the U.S. but also to establish a self-sustaining (self funding) DAO revenue model. This model will leverage JAM Toasters to provide essential blockchain infrastructure, generate yields, and facilitate automated core-time trading, with all revenues reinvested into the campaign to support our continued presence and growth in the U.S. market.

### Objective

![](JAM_Cycle.png)

As stated, the primary objective of this campaign is to grow Polkadot’s presence and influence in the U.S. marketplace by fostering strategic partnerships, engaging with the developer community, and deploying critical infrastructure. By integrating JAM Toasters and engaging in Core-Time Mercantile, we will create a loop of self-sustaining (self-funding) support for BizDev and DevRel activities. JAM Toasters will support validator and collator operations while generating yield to fund ongoing initiatives, and Core-Time Mercantile will facilitate the dynamic use of JAM core-time to power chains spun up with Tanssi, reinforcing our commitment to scalability and network resilience.

### Scope of Activities
