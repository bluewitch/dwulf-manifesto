My current Rust development environment is 100% written in Rust. This really shows how far Rust has come as a programming language for building fast and robust software.

This is my current setup:

- Terminal emulator: [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - simple and fast.
    
- Terminal multiplexer: [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) - looks good out of the box.
    
- Code editor: [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) - editing model better than Vim, LSP built-in.
    
- Language server: [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) - powerful.
    
- Shell: [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) - excellent completion features, easy to use as scripting language.
