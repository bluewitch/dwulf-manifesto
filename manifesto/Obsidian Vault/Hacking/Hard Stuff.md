Any hacker worth their salt needs gear that leverages the value of their skills.


# Base of OpSec
If you have a stationary "base of operations", then you have options for Base of OpSec, to include a Linux Box, Networking gear Modem/Router/Switch and a WiFi point.

Hardware, better known as gear allow the software, better known as tools to showcase a hacker's skill.  Hardware is the crucible of where it all starts, and what the software boots into.

In the nomenclature of systems, it all starts in the Box, well I call it that, the box that runs a operating system on the bare metal of the machine.  Typically housed on a PC (Personal Computer), in a tower frame in the old days, now the size of a hand held unit sometimes the size of a brick.

Paired to this is often a Modem, provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or a modem you provide that is compatible with their network.

A router and switch, hard wired to the Box can be apart of the assembly this can be configured with specialized software which can create security abstractions to further insulate the Box and provide an advanced degree of protection for the Box and everyone on your network, such as Bind9 DNS, VPN at the router level so guest do not have to bother with installing and configuring their own client VPN, also a Pi Hole, to block and filter unwanted ads from unknown or untrusted sources

WiFi hotspot is the final hardware in a lab that allows other devices to be connected to your network, and by proxy to the internet.

# Main Drivers
Your day to day gear, optimized, typically a powerful linux / window laptop and a android mobile device.  Both the laptop and mobile device functions can over lap, but sometimes a laptop is more capable and comfortable to handle, and a mobile device can tap into your messages and do more high level and stream lined operations

Main Drivers is simply your day-to-day device, a optimum combination is a powerful laptop and a mobile smart device.  Although, these devices are merging as technology is advancing, very soon A.I. agents and may become a hardware device on your wrist or as a piece of jewelry will be completely voice or gesture activated as a main driver.

# Professional Gear
Expanding beyond your main drivers can take your eyes to the air, your ear to the wire and your gear to the frequency.

This includes drones, thought and memory.

Professional gear go over and above the lab that houses your Box, Modem/Router/Switch, and WiFi hotspot and compliment your main drivers of a Laptop and mobile device.

For example a Drone gives you eyes in the sky and a expansion of wireless receiving and penetration tools, a micro-controller affords more granular control of your computational resources and Hak-gear, Pineapple (the hardware not the fruit), USB Rubber Ducky, and the Flipper expand your hacking capability exponentially
