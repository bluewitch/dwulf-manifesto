The Blackmarket Merchants, on the darknet, to buy drugs and illegal software.  With the goal of building and operating a Dark Merchant site.

Safety protocols are automatic when going into the darknet, and be any means should be the same even on the surface web.

System Setup
- Linux
- VPN
- TOR
- Browser, Firefox, Chrome, other?

The system set up can be on your own metal gear or on a dedicated Docker container, Linux your flavour of choice, we use Ubuntu, Firefox and Chrome, VPN and TOR though SSH, and always check the DNS integrity.

NINA sets up this through her Alpha (Security) protocols without the need for human remembrance or intervention.

User Setup
- email (proton, or custom)
- user profile (alias)
- public/private key hash (PGP)

User accounts will be required for registration mostly for building social street cred on the forums, Telegram, and Discord servers.  Emails typically index users in Web2 (Wallets for Web3 may serve as social and fiduciary score).  It is best to run your own email server, or run one through a reputable email service vendor.  Also it is essential to create a PGP key for secure communications.

BIANA sets up these social indexes, and builds a sentiment relation score, based on positive or negative banter.


Wallet Setup
- Trust
- Nova
- Talisman
- MyNode
- Monero

Wallet set up is geared to Web3 and serves as both a user account for social and financial interactivity.

The Wallet setup is the corner-stone of all user accounts.  This must be done air-gapped and off-line, inscribed on parchment or metal and protected from sight of others.

These wallet items are done by default with NINA who hands them to BIANA to back the wallet with capital.
