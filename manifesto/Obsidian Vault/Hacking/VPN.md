VPN Services
3rd party services that are professional VPNs,  I was using AirVPN (based in Italy) for a while.  These may be a better option in the future especially if they take crypto for payment.

- [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
- [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en)

I got the VPN service with Mullvad VPN, mostly to experiment with the VPN and the mullvad  browser, very stupid simple  and easy to use, had no issues setting it up

I could roll my own VPN, but sometimes it is more cost efficient to use paid services.  Pre-configuration and set up takes time and attention, and I just want to focus on hacking and make my security an automatic part of my boot-up.

I don't want to think about security.
