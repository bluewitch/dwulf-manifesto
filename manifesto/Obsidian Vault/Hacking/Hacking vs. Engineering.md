Hacking is what it sounds like, it deserves a space of its own, but is interwoven to the core of Software Engineering.

I am a hacker becoming an engineer.  My hacker side was born into me, I was always curious, and wanted to know how everthing works, and still do to this day, a chaotic ever learner.

The engineer, has solid book smarts and actually reads the fucking manual instead of blindly pushing buttons to see what happens, because more often than not, what happens is nothing to bad, and at best a new discovery, aka a zero-day

Engineering is an academic endeavor, and if implemented correctly, a solid architectural foundation.  However, without Hacking, Engineering is lacking to taking a active role in security and red team / blue team, measure / countermeasure exploits.

Hacking is a step up
