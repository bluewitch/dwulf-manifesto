As our interaction with computers and networks grow, more and more "accounts" that require usernames and passwords, these accounts grow and are constantly being added.

As it is bad form to use the same username and password pair for every account, so each new account sometimes has the same username, but typically has a different password.

Keeping strong, lengthy with various characters, upper and lower case, numbers and special characters can be memory intensive (for the human brain).

Password Managers do just that, they manage passwords, so you don't have to.
