So despite my best efforts to be apart of the "team Neurolanche", I am being ghosted by them.  I suspect it was because of the referendum 455, planet caravan, which failed and was rejected, but apparently was so embarrassing to them they had to note in the comments that they were in no way affiliated with me or my referendum.

They were all friendly and open arms before this, and afterwards, I have not heard a peep or been invited to any more meetings involving me on their dailies.

This went on for weeks, now pushing months, and while I can take a hint, I just want them to tell what the situation is with my involvement, and if I am no longer allowed to be apart of their click, have the fucking balls to tell me why.

It is a shame, as I was very excited to explore A.I. development for their cause, but like most things in life hopium and false promises are abundant in almost ever aspect of life.

I am a bit salty about this, especially after my demotion in the Astar ambassador program, now being ghosted by fellow ambassadors without rhyme or reason and I am left clueless to try to figure out what the fuck happened.

3 years, including the investment during the tenure of the crowdloans and pushing nothing but positive spin on Polkadot and its para-chains and I feel like a pariah when I should feel like I am part of a community.

The slow degradation of altruistic bonds makes me wonder if building those bonds was really worth it in the first place.  Even during my time as a ambassador I could feel the undercurrent of tribalism and the realization that it was not a all for one and one for all sentiment, but rather, skulduggery and reintroducing high school social clicks all over again.  Not what I signed up for.

Silver lining?

Certainly, a few bad apples and bad experiences with fellow ambassadors will not diminish the integrity of the Polkadot technology and its ecosystems.  I got involved because of the technology, not really because of the people and while being an ambassador of several chains, made me feel apart of the community, it was also difficult to cultivate and coordinate being naive to the internal and external politics I had no clue about.

While Astar demoted me in rank and Neurolanche and their dApp straight up ghosted me after inviting me to be apart of their team.  Phala remained neutral, and really did not give any direction in how to participate.  Polkadot, seemed to do just the opposite.  Promoted to senior ambassador and even an invite to private Telegram groups.  I also have many friends that I have worked with at Polkadot, so there seems to be a ray of hope that needs to be refocused to the core of developing Polkadot and BizDev on their behalf.

So new intents with new goals, not so dependent on tribalism and social clicks, but more involved with building the technologies of meaningful purpose.
