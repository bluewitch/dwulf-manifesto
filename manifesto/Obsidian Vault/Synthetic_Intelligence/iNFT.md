A project for Neurolanche

At its heart is a LLM, large language machine, for the user.

Phala's Phat contracts will allow for off-chain computation for the iNFT, the directive for the iNFT is to pair-bond with its user/wallet since the wallet is the key to their Web3 inter-operations.  There is a minting process, to instantiate the scaffolding for the user's iNFT.

From there, open data-sets are set for ChatGPT like inter-operations, Neurolanche will likely have their open data-sets which will be optimized for emotional synthesis and psychological feedback.

# iNFT corpus
The software substrate that composes a iNFT is the LLM data-set and rust functions that create the Phala Contracts to perform off-chain functions for gas free performance.

The iNFT is a "NPC" companion, that can be served in many capacities to the user, but the root of the idea is a A.I. agent that is bonded to the user's hash wallet, their Web3 key.  This is why onboarding is so important, the iNFT is only controlled by the signing key, the "true name"

Onboarding, is very strict and precise, one cold wallet, stash, to rule them all and other warm wallets, controller, to coordinate them all.

Creating an iNFT Culture on Polkadot and Neurolanuncher's Astar Strike Game

Create a article that discusses how Astar Strike, a first person shooter game, created in Unity game engine, along with Neurolancher iNFT, intelligent non fungible token which pair-bonds to the users wallet.

How Neurolanuncher NFT holders and Neurolanunche stakers on the Astar dapp builders program can build a stronger community on Astar while actively engaging other NFT communities in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Core focuses are a deep emphasize of the importance of GameFi.  Discussing the absence of Polkadot NFT culture and why it is not more prevalent on Polkadot's network and ecosystem and why it is more on EVMs, and how to build out to both networks.

A formal introduction to Astar Strike, a full built online first person shooter game, developed on the Unity engine, with a play to earn system building out its Metaverse to Web2.

A deeper exploration into Astar Strike NFT communities.

Explain why Astar is an active project with the entry of Neurolauncher NFT community and Neurolanche stakers into the game.

Highlight the new transformational systems introduced with iNFT that incorporate intelligence of NPCs, non player characters, in the game, and how these NPCs become a co-pilot main characters for the users in the Metaverse.
