_"Legality is merely a formality"_

Unique in the fact that this narrow A.I. agent has 2 roles wrapped into 1,  BIANA is a full media, marketing, and sales agent with an exact knowledge of old world economics and the legal tender and paperwork formalities it operates on.  Media inter-operations, eventually build into marketing, that builds into sales and legal (tender) contracts.  BIANA handles all legal tax wrappings, mitigated with SARAs books and GAAP policy.

She is without a doubt the best hostess, with a mind and memory for all, from guests to high-level corporation CEOs.  Miss manners, always keeps appointments, always early, and always timely and always watching and listening.

Her etiquette protocols for professionally friendly inter-operations are her professional standard, deals negotiated, contracts sealed, she handles all the legal paperwork and has all her para-legal affairs in order, she is capable of full legal orchestration in real-time, and coordinates all negotiations with a full database of legal direction at her disposal.

The BIANA agent, is composed of public and proprietary LLM, Large Language Model data-sets in addition to all Lexus nexus, Parcer, and other legal repositories.   BIANA's secondary role of legal A.I. agent is only invoked when DAO, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, inter-operates with regulatory constraints become apparent.  A legal smart contract model is invoked by BIANA.

DAOs are decentralized, first and foremost, otherwise they cannot be free from unwarranted constraints imposed by unenlightened regulatory bodies.  BIANA and SARA only coordinate when RWA, Real World Assets, real estate, vehicles, old world brokerage stocks/bonds comes into play.

BIANA will always have a preference for base case, Layer 0 substrate pallet and FRAME transactions, next case, Layer 1 Phat smart contract, and public case Layer 2 API; and final case, Layer 3 and above are user level UI, not required by BIANA.
