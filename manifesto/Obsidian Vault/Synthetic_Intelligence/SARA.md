SARA keeps the books for old world economy and new world economy inter-operations.  She often works in tandem with BIANA when documenting credits and debits on accounting records for proper reflection for regulation mandates.

Her domain is narrow scoped to accounting, book keeping, and report writing.  She is built mostly to off-set BIANA's work load and bandwidth for legal issues involving accounting and legal tender.

SARA's data-set is focused on GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and accounting software API Object interaction and parsing, to construct the books.

SARA serves as a intelligent data-base for BIANA, and BIANA uses her as a system to mint RWA, real world assets, to NFTs and create legal documents in jurisdictions that allow them.
