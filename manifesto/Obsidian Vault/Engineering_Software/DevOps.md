Originally DevOps was 2 separate work loads, one, Development, to _develop_ in the code and the other, operations, to _administrate_ and implement the code-base.  Together, combined, that is the core of DevOps, both are honestly required, being able to develop the code and being able to properly administer it through a DevOp cycle.  For most developers, writing code in silos, can be common practice for the majority of core Rust only developers but the DevOps cycle should be apart of their flow whether they work in a silo or with a team.

The Operations part of DevOps, allow a proper administration and thus implementation of code that is being developed.  In a proper dynamic that leads itself to automation if designed and configured well.  Ideally all DevOp tools would be in [[Rust]], but practically, there are configuration nuances that are not actual languages themselves or language agnostic, mostly text configuration files, and object files [[JSON]] and [[YAML]] to name a few.

All projects, including both [[Web2]] and [[Web3]] projects, will almost always use this DevOp pattern and their respective parts. [[Git Repositories]], [[CIDC Automation]], [[Docker containers]], [[Kubernetes orchestration]], and  [[Prometheus]] for monitoring and [[Grafana ]]for human UI display.

# Kubernetes

In the realm of container orchestration, Kubernetes reigns supreme. While Docker has its own container management features, Kubernetes takes container orchestration to a whole new level. Think of Kubernetes as the conductor of a complex symphony, ensuring all your containers play harmoniously together.

## Understanding Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Key Concepts in Kubernetes

### Pods
In the world of Kubernetes, the smallest deployable units are called "pods." A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace, IP address, and storage volume. Think of a pod as a logical host for your containers.

### Services
Kubernetes Services provide a way to expose your application to the network or other services. They act as load balancers, ensuring that traffic reaches the appropriate pods, even as pods are created or scaled.

### Deployments
Deployments are Kubernetes resources that manage the lifecycle of your applications. They enable you to declaratively describe the desired state of your application and let Kubernetes handle the rest, including scaling and rolling updates.

### ConfigMaps and Secrets
ConfigMaps and Secrets allow you to decouple configuration data from container images. They provide a way to manage sensitive information like passwords and API keys securely.

### Volumes
Kubernetes Volumes provide a mechanism for containers to persist data beyond the container's lifecycle. You can use various types of volumes, such as emptyDir, hostPath, and Persistent Volumes (PVs), depending on your needs.

## Why Choose Kubernetes?

- **Scalability:** Kubernetes enables you to effortlessly scale your application up or down to meet changing demands.
- **High Availability:** Kubernetes ensures that your applications remain available even in the face of hardware or software failures.
- **Self-Healing:** If a container or node fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it to maintain the desired state.
- **Portability:** Kubernetes works seamlessly across various cloud providers and on-premises data centers, providing true hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities.

## Getting Started with Kubernetes
1. **Installation:** Begin by setting up a Kubernetes cluster, either on your local machine using tools like Minikube or in a production environment using managed Kubernetes services from cloud providers.
2. **kubectl:** This command-line tool is your primary interface to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. Use it to create, inspect, and manage Kubernetes resources.
3. **Deployments:** Start by defining a Deployment resource to manage your application. Specify the desired container image, replicas, and other configuration details.
4. **Services:** Expose your application using a Kubernetes Service to make it accessible to other services or users.
5. **Explore:** Dive deeper into Kubernetes, exploring advanced features like StatefulSets, Helm charts, and Operators.

Kubernetes is your ticket to orchestrating containerized applications at scale. With its rich ecosystem of tools and resources, you can unlock the true potential of containerization and cloud-native computing.
