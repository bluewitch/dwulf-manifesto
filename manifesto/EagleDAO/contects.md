**Step 1: Categorize Your Connections**

* **DevOps/Blockchain/Polkadot**: Identify contacts related to these topics (e.g., blockchain developers, DevOps engineers, 
Polkadot enthusiasts).
* **Business Opportunities**: Separate out contacts who might be interested in collaborating with you as a chain developer or 
advisor.
* **Opsec-Related**: Group contacts involved in cybersecurity, risk management, and operational security.

**Step 2: Create Lists and Labels**

On LinkedIn:

* Create custom lists for each category (e.g., "DevOps/Blockchain/Polkadot", "Business Opportunities", "Opsec-Related").
* Use LinkedIn's built-in labels to categorize your connections. You can create custom labels like:
	+ #Blockchain
	+ #DevOps
	+ #Polkadot
	+ #Opsec
	+ #BusinessOpportunities
	+ #ChainDeveloper

On Telegram:

* Create separate channels or groups for each category, using descriptive names (e.g., "Blockchain Enthusiasts", "DevOps 
Professionals", etc.).
* Use the chat features to organize your conversations and prioritize contacts.

**Step 3: Filter Your Connections**

Use LinkedIn's search function to filter your connections by:

* Industry (e.g., Blockchain, DevOps, Cybersecurity)
* Job title (e.g., Developer, Engineer, Consultant)
* Location (if you want to focus on specific regions or cities)

On Telegram, use the chat features to create custom filters for each group/channels. This will help you prioritize messages from 
relevant contacts.

**Step 4: Prioritize Your Connections**

Based on your goals and priorities:

* **Prioritize**: Focus on connections in the "DevOps/Blockchain/Polkadot" category, as they are most relevant to your 
professional development.
* **Nurture**: Engage with contacts in the "Business Opportunities" category to explore potential collaborations or consulting 
opportunities.
* **Maintain**: Keep an eye on connections in the "Opsec-Related" category, but may not prioritize them as highly.

**Step 5: Review and Refine**

Regularly review your connection lists and labels to:

* Remove contacts who are no longer relevant
* Add new connections that align with your priorities
* Refine your labels and categories based on changing circumstances

By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively organize your contacts on LinkedIn and Telegram, focusing on the most 
relevant and valuable connections for your professional development and business opportunities.
