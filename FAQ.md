- **Project**: What the project entails and its ultimate goal.
- **Particulars**: Specific requirements and expectations from my role.
- **Payment**: Agreed-upon payment channels and digital asset wallets for seamless transactions.

# Engagement Guidelines  

Clear and professional engagement policies are essential to ensure alignment, efficiency, and mutual respect in all collaborations. Below are the key points of interest for engaging with me, along with the rationale for why these policies are non-negotiable.  

---

## 1. Remote Work Policy  

**Policy:**  
All roles must include remote work options to support flexibility and maintain productivity. If a position requires on-site presence with limited or no remote flexibility, the contract must comprehensively address relocation needs, including housing, travel, and associated expenses.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Efficiency:** Remote work allows for better time management and eliminates the inefficiencies of daily commuting, enabling more focus on project delivery.  
- **Global Reach:** Working remotely provides the flexibility to collaborate across time zones and regions, which is particularly important for international projects.  
- **Adaptability:** As a professional managing multiple responsibilities, remote work ensures that I can contribute effectively without the logistical challenges of relocation.  
- **Relocation Contingency:** For on-site roles, fair and comprehensive support ensures that relocation is not a financial or logistical burden.

## 2. Preferred Employment Structure  

**Policy:**  
Engagements are primarily conducted through a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, particularly within the **GreenWitchDAO** framework. Alternatively, 1099 contract-based arrangements are acceptable for project-specific needs. W2 employment is generally avoided as it does not align with my operational philosophy or professional model.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Alignment with Decentralization:** Working through a DAO reflects my commitment to decentralized ecosystems and blockchain-based governance structures.  
- **Flexibility and Autonomy:** Contract-based engagements provide the necessary independence to manage multiple projects efficiently while delivering high-value outcomes.  
- **Tax and Financial Efficiency:** 1099 structures offer greater control over financial planning, which is critical for professionals managing crypto-based compensation.  
- **Mismatch with W2 Employment:** The rigidity and administrative overhead of W2 employment conflict with the agile and self-sovereign approach that defines my professional ethos.

## 3. Project and Compensation Scope  

**Policy:**  
Compensation discussions begin only after full disclosure and understanding of project details, scope, and budget. Preliminary discussions may reference market rates but are subject to adjustment based on project-specific complexities and deliverables.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Transparency First:** A clear understanding of the project ensures that the compensation reflects the effort, complexity, and value of the work.  
- **Avoiding Misalignment:** Premature discussions about compensation without project details can lead to unrealistic expectations and inefficiencies.  
- **Market Relevance:** Initial rates based on local market standards provide a fair starting point but may not account for specialized skills or blockchain-specific expertise.  
- **Professional Integrity:** Aligning compensation with the project scope ensures mutual respect and equitable value exchange.  

---

## 4. Compensation Method  

**Policy:**  
All payments are to be made in cryptocurrency, with a strong preference for **BTC (Bitcoin)** transactions. Alternative cryptocurrencies such as **ETH**, **USDC**, or **DOT** may also be considered depending on project agreements.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Alignment with Blockchain Principles:** Crypto payments reflect the decentralized ethos of blockchain projects and eliminate reliance on traditional banking systems.  
- **Global Accessibility:** Cryptocurrency offers seamless, cross-border transactions without the delays or fees associated with fiat currency systems.  
- **Security and Transparency:** Payments in crypto are transparent, immutable, and secure, aligning with modern financial standards.  
- **Preference for BTC:** As a widely adopted and highly secure digital asset, Bitcoin is the preferred choice for its stability and recognition within the blockchain ecosystem.
