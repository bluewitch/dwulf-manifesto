# Frequently Asked Questions
### Projects, Particulars, Payment
FAQ centers around the 3 "P"s, Projects (what it is), Particulars (what is required for it), Payment (payment channels to do it).  Before any roles or contracts will be considered 3 "P"s must be agreed to, the type of projects that are being worked on, the paticulars of what is required to work on them and the payment (renumeeration) for working on the projects with the correct particulars.

## Engagement Guidelines:

1. ***Remote Work Policy:*** We insist on the provision of remote work options for all roles. In the event that a role is mandated to be on-site and does not permit any degree of remote work flexibility, the contractual agreement must henceforth include comprehensive relocation and housing subsidies.

2. ***Preferred Employment Type:*** Our preference is to engage via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) employment structure to the GreenWitchDAO. We are open to considering 1099 contract roles based on the specific project requirements. However, we do not typically prefer or consider W2 employment positions.

3. ***Compensation:*** Without specific knowledge of the project or its particulars, it's not feasible to determine an appropriate compensation level. We prefer to engage in compensation negotiations once a budget has been outlined, project details are fully disclosed and understood, and an offer has been extended. Until such time, local market rates can be employed as a preliminary reference point to guage compensation.
