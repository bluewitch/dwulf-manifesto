# Frequently Asked Questions

## Rules of Engagement

### Must have remote options

All mandated onsite roles that can not or will not offer any professional remote option flexibility must include full relocation and full housing subsidies as a part of the contract going forward.  Thanks.

### DAO Employment prefered
1099 contract roles are considered depending on project and W2 positions are not even considered or prefered

### What are you seeking in compensation?
Without knowing the project or the project details, I am unable to assess an accurate level of fair compensation. I would be more comfortable negotiating these numbers after a budget is established, the project and details of said project are known and only after a offer is made.

Current local market rates are a good starting point until project and budget details are known
