# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
**Projects, Particulars, Payment** – a Framework for Collaboration  

Our FAQ is organized around three key components, the "3 P's": **Projects**, **Particulars**, and **Payment**. These categories ensure transparency and alignment before considering roles or contracts:

- **Project**: What the project entails and its ultimate goal.
- **Particulars**: Specific requirements and expectations from my role.
- **Payment**: Agreed-upon payment channels and digital asset wallets for seamless transactions.

## Engagement Guidelines

### 1. Remote Work Policy
All roles require remote work options to accommodate flexibility and productivity. If a position mandates on-site presence with limited or no remote flexibility, the contract must provide comprehensive support for relocation, including assistance with housing and related expenses.

### 2. Preferred Employment Structure
Our primary engagement preference is through a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, specifically within the **GreenWitchDAO** framework. We are also open to 1099 contract-based arrangements, especially for blockchain and AI projects. However, W2 employment is generally not a preferred model, as it does not align with our business operations and philosophy.

### 3. Project and Compensation Scope
Determining compensation accurately requires a detailed understanding of the project’s scope and budget. Discussions around compensation will commence only after project details are fully disclosed and understood, and a formal offer is provided. Until these details are clarified, general market rates serve as a preliminary guide.

### 4. Compensation Method
All payments are to be made in cryptocurrency, with a strong preference for **BTC (Bitcoin)** transactions.
