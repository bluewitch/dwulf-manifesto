# Engagement Guidelines  

Clear and professional engagement policies are essential to ensure alignment, efficiency, and mutual respect in all collaborations. Below are the key points of interest for engaging with me, along with the rationale for why these policies are non-negotiable.  

---

## 1. Remote Work Policy  

**Policy:**  
All roles must include remote work options to support flexibility and maintain productivity. If a position requires on-site presence with limited or no remote flexibility, the contract must comprehensively address relocation needs, including housing, travel, and associated expenses.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Efficiency:** Remote work allows for better time management and eliminates the inefficiencies of daily commuting, enabling more focus on project delivery.  
- **Global Reach:** Working remotely provides the flexibility to collaborate across time zones and regions, which is particularly important for international projects.  
- **Adaptability:** As a professional managing multiple responsibilities, remote work ensures that I can contribute effectively without the logistical challenges of relocation.  
- **Relocation Contingency:** For on-site roles, fair and comprehensive support ensures that relocation is not a financial or logistical burden.  

---

## 2. Preferred Employment Structure  

**Policy:**  
Engagements are primarily conducted through a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, particularly within the **GreenWitchDAO** framework. Alternatively, 1099 contract-based arrangements are acceptable for project-specific needs. W2 employment is generally avoided as it does not align with my operational philosophy or professional model.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Alignment with Decentralization:** Working through a DAO reflects my commitment to decentralized ecosystems and blockchain-based governance structures.  
- **Flexibility and Autonomy:** Contract-based engagements provide the necessary independence to manage multiple projects efficiently while delivering high-value outcomes.  
- **Tax and Financial Efficiency:** 1099 structures offer greater control over financial planning, which is critical for professionals managing crypto-based compensation.  
- **Mismatch with W2 Employment:** The rigidity and administrative overhead of W2 employment conflict with the agile and self-sovereign approach that defines my professional ethos.  

---

## 3. Project and Compensation Scope  

**Policy:**  
Compensation discussions begin only after full disclosure and understanding of project details, scope, and budget. Preliminary discussions may reference market rates but are subject to adjustment based on project-specific complexities and deliverables.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Transparency First:** A clear understanding of the project ensures that the compensation reflects the effort, complexity, and value of the work.  
- **Avoiding Misalignment:** Premature discussions about compensation without project details can lead to unrealistic expectations and inefficiencies.  
- **Market Relevance:** Initial rates based on local market standards provide a fair starting point but may not account for specialized skills or blockchain-specific expertise.  
- **Professional Integrity:** Aligning compensation with the project scope ensures mutual respect and equitable value exchange.  

---

## 4. Compensation Method  

**Policy:**  
All payments are to be made in cryptocurrency, with a strong preference for **BTC (Bitcoin)** transactions. Alternative cryptocurrencies such as **ETH**, **USDC**, or **DOT** may also be considered depending on project agreements.  

**Rationale:**  
- **Alignment with Blockchain Principles:** Crypto payments reflect the decentralized ethos of blockchain projects and eliminate reliance on traditional banking systems.  
- **Global Accessibility:** Cryptocurrency offers seamless, cross-border transactions without the delays or fees associated with fiat currency systems.  
- **Security and Transparency:** Payments in crypto are transparent, immutable, and secure, aligning with modern financial standards.  
- **Preference for BTC:** As a widely adopted and highly secure digital asset, Bitcoin is the preferred choice for its stability and recognition within the blockchain ecosystem.

# JavaScript Developer FAQ

### 1. **Explain Event Delegation**
**Q: What is event delegation, and why is it useful?**

**A:** Event delegation is a technique in the DOM where you add an event listener to a parent element rather than directly to its child elements. It works due to event bubbling (or propagation), where an event triggered on a child element propagates up to its parent elements.

**How it works:** When an event occurs on a target element, it bubbles up to its ancestors in the DOM tree. By attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor, you can handle events on dynamically created child elements without needing to re-bind event listeners.

**Example:**
```javascript
const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
parent.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target && event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(`Clicked on item: ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});

// Dynamically add a new child
const newItem = document.createElement('li');
newItem.textContent = 'New Item';
parent.appendChild(newItem);
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces memory usage by attaching fewer listeners.
- Automatically handles dynamically added elements.
- Simplifies code for managing multiple child elements.

### 2. **How Does `this` Work in JavaScript?**
**Q: What is `this` in JavaScript, and how does it differ from other languages?**

**A:** In JavaScript, `this` refers to the context in which a function is executed, and its value is determined by how the function is called, not where it is defined. This behavior differs from many object-oriented languages where `this` always refers to the instance of a class.

#### Common Scenarios:
1. **Global Context:**
   ```javascript
   console.log(this); // In a browser: Window object
   ```

2. **Object Method:**
   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     name: 'Alice',
     greet() {
       console.log(this.name); // 'Alice'
     }
   };
   obj.greet();
   ```

3. **Arrow Functions:**
   Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from their surrounding context.
   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     name: 'Alice',
     greet: () => {
       console.log(this.name); // undefined in most cases
     }
   };
   obj.greet();
   ```

4. **Explicit Binding:** Using `call`, `apply`, or `bind` to set `this`:
   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     console.log(this.name);
   }
   const obj = { name: 'Alice' };
   greet.call(obj); // 'Alice'
   ```

---

### 3. **How Prototypal Inheritance Works**
**Q: What is prototypal inheritance, and how does it compare to class inheritance?**

**A:** Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods directly from other objects. In JavaScript, every object has an internal link to its prototype (`[[Prototype]]`), which is accessed via `Object.getPrototypeOf()` or `__proto__`.

**Example:**
```javascript
const parent = {
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello');
  }
};

const child = Object.create(parent);
child.greet(); // 'Hello'
```

**Comparison with Class Inheritance:**
- **Prototypal Inheritance:** Flexible, objects inherit directly from other objects.
- **Class Inheritance:** Involves defining classes and creating instances.

---

### 4. **What is the Difference Between `null` and `undefined`?**
**Q: How do `null` and `undefined` differ, and how can you check for them?**

**A:**
- **`undefined`:** Indicates a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or a property does not exist.
- **`null`:** Represents an intentional absence of value.

**Example:**
```javascript
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
```

**Checking for `null` and `undefined`:**
```javascript
if (value === null) {
  console.log('Value is null');
}
if (value === undefined) {
  console.log('Value is undefined');
}
```

---

### 5. **What is a Closure?**
**Q: What is a closure, and how do you use it?**

**A:** A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.

**Example:**
```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);
  };
}

const closure = outerFunction('outside');
closure('inside'); // Outer: outside, Inner: inside
```

**Use Cases:**
- Encapsulation and private variables.
- Creating function factories.
- Implementing memoization.

---

### 6. **Difference Between `forEach` and `map`**
**Q: What is the difference between `Array.forEach()` and `Array.map()`?**

**A:**
- **`forEach`:** Executes a provided function for each array element but does not return a new array.
- **`map`:** Executes a provided function for each array element and returns a new array with the results.

**Example:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2)); // Logs 2, 4, 6

const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
```

Use `forEach` for side effects and `map` when you need a transformed array.

---

### 7. **What is the Event Loop?**
**Q: Can you explain the event loop and its role in JavaScript?**

**A:** The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that manages asynchronous operations. It ensures that the call stack is empty before executing tasks from the task queue or microtask queue.

**How it Works:**
1. JavaScript executes code in the call stack.
2. When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is added to the task queue.
3. The event loop moves tasks from the task queue to the call stack when the stack is empty.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

console.log('End');

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Timeout
```

### 8. **Differences Between `var`, `let`, and `const`**
**Q: What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**

**A:**
- **`var`:**
  - Function-scoped.
  - Can be redeclared.
  - Hoisted with `undefined`.

- **`let`:**
  - Block-scoped.
  - Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
  - Hoisted but not initialized.

- **`const`:**
  - Block-scoped.
  - Must be initialized at declaration.
  - Immutable binding (value can change, reference cannot).

**Example:**
```javascript
var a = 10; // Function-scoped
let b = 20; // Block-scoped
const c = 30; // Immutable binding
```

---

### 9. **What is the Difference Between `==` and `===`?**
**Q: How do `==` and `===` differ?**

**A:**
- **`==`:** Compares values for equality after type coercion.
- **`===`:** Compares values and types for strict equality.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log(5 == '5'); // true (type coercion)
console.log(5 === '5'); // false (different types)
```
