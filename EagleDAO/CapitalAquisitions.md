## Polkadot Referendums

This can pertain to either Kusama or Polkadot. Referendums are community appeals for projects to access funds from the Polkadot treasury, similar to political campaigns. During the discussion phase, interest in the project should be increased. The 28-day cycle for referendums requires careful planning and preparation.

## Web3 Grants

Primarily sourced from Parity funding, but may also include grants from other chains and sister chains.

## Donations

Always accepted and honored. There can be no greater gift than one from the heart.
