Revenue generation for the Eagle DAO that is over and above what FARA yields internally, Capital Acquisitions is outside capital for the Eagle DAO treasury.  The Capital Aquired is held in a liquidity wallet and set to provide resources for Polkadot and Polkadot JAM projects (i.e., infra, dapps, NFC, payment channels, fiat gateways and credit debit cards).

## Polkadot Referendums
This can pertain to either Kusama or Polkadot. Referendums are community appeals for projects to access funds from the Polkadot treasury, similar to political campaigns. During the discussion phase, interest in the project should be increased. The 28-day cycle for referendums requires careful planning and preparation.

### Referendums
- Planet Caravan, build out network, establish DevRel with automotive
