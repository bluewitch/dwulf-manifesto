What is ELF in Polkadot Substrate?

In the context of Polkadot Substrate:

### Executable and Linkable Format (ELF):
ELF is a widely used standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. Within Substrate, it represents the structure of how compiled Wasm (WebAssembly) binaries are stored and executed.

### Substrate Runtime and ELF:
The Substrate runtime, the core logic layer of a blockchain (responsible for transactions, consensus, and governance), is compiled into WebAssembly (Wasm). These Wasm files can sometimes be wrapped in ELF for specific runtime environments. ELF acts as a container format to manage the binaries and support dynamic linking or execution.

### Optimized Runtime Deployment:
ELF integration ensures that Substrate runtimes are portable and platform-agnostic. This allows parachains (and the Polkadot relay chain) to execute blockchain logic efficiently across diverse systems without re-compilation for every architecture.

### Security in Deployment:
ELF in Substrate is used to ensure that runtime logic is packaged securely, minimizing vulnerabilities during deployment or runtime updates.

In summary, the JAM Verifier is a critical tool for ensuring trust and security in decentralized ecosystems, and ELF in Substrate represents a key technology enabling cross-platform runtime deployment for blockchain networks. Both contribute to enhancing security, efficiency, and trust in the Polkadot ecosystem.
