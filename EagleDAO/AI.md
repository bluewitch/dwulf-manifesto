# A.I. Agents

### Strategy for Incorporating A.I. Agents

#### **Defining Distinct Roles and Domains**

- **NINA** (Network Intelligence and Numerical Analysis): Dedicated to optimizing blockchain interactions and network analysis, enhancing the DAO's technological infrastructure.
- **FARA** (Forensic Analysis and Regulatory Advisor): Focuses on financial and numerical data analysis, crucial for managing DAOâ€™s assets and economic decisions.
- **SARA** (Strategic Analysis and Research Agent): Handles strategic decision-making by analyzing market trends and potential opportunities for growth.
- **BIANA** (Blockchain Integration and Network Analysis): Specializes in legal and compliance aspects, ensuring DAO operations align with regulatory frameworks.
- ---
- **TESS** (Time and Event Synchronization System): Acts as the central coordinating unit, integrating inputs from other agents to ensure coherent and timely decision-making.

The Eagle DAO chain, is on Tanssi (Substrate), and we are working on decentralized A.I. agents NINA to protect, FARA to inspect, SARA runs the numbers, BIANA is where media meets contracts.

#### **Inter-Agent Communication and Collaboration**

- A robust inter-agent communication protocol to allow seamless data exchange and collaboration among NINA, FARA, SARA, BIANA, and TESS can be done through extrinsics and XCM,XCMP.  When Polkadot JAM sevices comes online they will just be `services`.
- A data-set implementation for a system where these A.I. agents (or any agent) can request and share insights, forming a collaborative network that enhances overall decision-making.  This will be put on the PVM.




# A.I. Agent NINA

## Security (Alpha Protocol)

The NINA A.I. Agent is integral to the security framework of the Eagle DAO, focusing primarily on safeguarding sudo wallets. NINA's capabilities include:

- **Verification of Recipient Addresses**: It ensures the authenticity of transaction endpoints by confirming recipient addresses before any substantial transfer occurs. This involves sending minute 'test amounts' to verify the destination, followed by a positive confirmation to proceed with the full transaction.
  
- **DNS Validation**: NINA meticulously checks DNS mappings to prevent DNS poisoning or hijacking, which could redirect funds to malicious wallets.

- **Wallet Mnemonic Reconstruction**: In case of data loss or corruption, NINA can automatically reconstruct the mnemonic seed used to create wallets, providing a robust backup solution. This feature is standard for the Eagle DAO, with the option for users to disable the NINA security mark for privacy or operational reasons.

## DevOps (Beta Protocol)

NINA extends its utility into DevOps by:

- **Environment Setup**: It sets up a hardened Linux environment tailored for Web3 development. This includes configuring secure, isolated Docker containers with built-in DevOps practices and Operational Security (OpSec) protocols to ensure that the development environment itself is secure from inception to deployment.

- **Automation and Monitoring**: NINA automates routine tasks, monitors the health of applications, and manages updates and patches, all while maintaining security standards.

## Hacking (Omega Protocol)

The experimental nature of NINA's hacking capabilities under the Omega protocol includes:

- **Sticky Bear Mode**: This feature is enabled by default. Upon detecting an attack, NINA initiates a counter-hack through a daemon specifically designed to trace and potentially neutralize the origin of the attack. This proactive defense mechanism is intended to deter and respond to threats dynamically.

- **Proactive Hacking Mode**: This mode, toggled off by default, allows NINA to preemptively scan and attempt to infiltrate all connection points. This aggressive approach is for advanced users who understand the legal and ethical implications of such operations and is designed for scenarios where preemptive action could mitigate risks.

## Conclusion

The NINA A.I. Agent represents a triple-threat in security, DevOps efficiency, and offensive cybersecurity capabilities. Its integration within the Eagle DAO ecosystem not only fortifies the security posture of the EagleDAO, but also enhances operational productivity and introduces a novel approach to cybersecurity with its experimental hacking features. Users leveraging NINA must be well-versed in cybersecurity laws and ethics due to the potential aggressive nature of its hacking protocols.
