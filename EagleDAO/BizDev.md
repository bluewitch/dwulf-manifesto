I have been active in BizDev, however, I lean more towards DevRel. Despite this, here is our list of clients for our Eagle DAO consulting division:

# Wheel House (Construction)
Our case study for Wheel House is to deploy a chain that will manage payroll and escrow systems that are interlaced with a scheduling system. 
A base multi-sig wallet will be the foundational wallet for the Wheel House DAO.

# Daze of the Wolf (Media)
Daze of the Wolf is a media system for the production of social media. A chain will be deployed, with coin/tokens, to mint NFT objects to interact, and gamify the platform. The main productions are:

- **10-minute technology news**, rendered by A.I. agent (avatar and voice)
- **20-minute hacking and technical edutainment**, A.I. assisted but with a combination of live streams and memes
- **30-minute "radio show" drama**, sci-fi series episodic

It is revenue-driven by:
- Subscription
- NFT sales/mining
- Social monetization
- Retail selling (coffee, mushrooms, t-shirts, mugs, gadgets, etc.)
