# Eagle DAO Business Clients
Here is our list of clients for our Eagle DAO consulting division:

# Wheel House (Construction)
Wheelhouse Construction is a construction firm in South Carolina, that is top notch and cutting edge, building houses that dreams are made of, beautiful and practical works of engineering art.

Our proper Polkadot case study for Wheel House is to deploy a chain on Tanssi, with a coin/token component, that will manage payroll and distribute directly to the wallets of employees/contractotrs, also a escrow system that, locks funds and distributes payments as milestones are met and are interlaced with a scheduling system (clickup).

A base multi-sig wallet will serve as the foundational wallet for the Wheel House DAO.

# Greenwitch DAO (Revenue A.I. Agent)
Originally, Greenwitch Productions LLC was dissolved and reemerged as Greenwitch DAO. Greenwitch DAO is embedded with A.I. agents that utilize the aggregate of all available datasets (Grok, OpenAI, Deepseeker, Claude, etc.), including its own.

- Primary Function: Revenue generation
- Secondary Function: User onboarding (secure wallet)
- Tertiary Function: DID (or legal wrapping, KYC)

TESS is the interface for the DAO, which helps pair-bond the user interface for the DAO. Only first-generation wallets are required for the credentials for standard Web3 sign-ins to the DAO site. Zero-generation wallets, enshrined by NINA, are once removed to prevent compromise of private keys and mnemonics.
