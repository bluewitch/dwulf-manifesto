# A.I. Agents

### Strategy for Incorporating A.I. Agents

#### **Defining Distinct Roles and Domains**

- **NINA** (Network Intelligence and Numerical Analysis): Dedicated to optimizing blockchain interactions and network analysis, enhancing the DAO's technological infrastructure.
- **FARA** (Forensic Analysis and Regulatory Advisor): Focuses on financial and numerical data analysis, crucial for managing DAOâ€™s assets and economic decisions.
- **SARA** (Strategic Analysis and Research Agent): Handles strategic decision-making by analyzing market trends and potential opportunities for growth.
- **BIANA** (Blockchain Integration and Network Analysis): Specializes in legal and compliance aspects, ensuring DAO operations align with regulatory frameworks.
- **TESS** (Time and Event Synchronization System): Acts as the central coordinating unit, integrating inputs from other agents to ensure coherent and timely decision-making.

The Eagle DAO chain, is on Tanssi (Substrate), and we are working on decentralized A.I. agents NINA to protect, FARA to inspect, SARA runs the numbers, BIANA is where media meets contracts.

#### **Inter-Agent Communication and Collaboration**

- A robust inter-agent communication protocol to allow seamless data exchange and collaboration among NINA, FARA, SARA, BIANA, and TESS can be done through extrinsics and XCM,XCMP.  When Polkadot JAM sevices comes online they will just be `services`.
- A data-set implementation for a system where these A.I. agents (or any agent) can request and share insights, forming a collaborative network that enhances overall decision-making.  This will be put on the PVM.
