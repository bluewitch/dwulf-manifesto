# DevRel Development Relations
Building the Polkadot developer's foundation.  This bleeds into some very technical stuff, to work with business and enterprises with already functioning Web2 systems.  The Eagle DAO goal is to assist in the aclumation of the Web3 environment.

The idea is to build your OS as your agent, a hardened system (perferably Linux based), that has everything set up for Polkadot JAM development.  We can put this on a Docker container and that would be the first thing we point to if the business client is already tech savvy and has their own cloud.  I will lay out my bare metal plan to illustrate that this can be built better with your own device and to shave cloud costs.  In the end we are targeting the replication of Polkadot JAM servers (and services) for the Eagle DAO.
