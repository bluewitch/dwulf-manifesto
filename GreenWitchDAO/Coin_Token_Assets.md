# Coin Token Assets
Assets on the chain, can be in the form of Coin/Token assets.  The term Coin and the term Token are often used...


## GreenWitch DAO Token (GDT)
A native coin/token for the GreenWitchDAO, for voting and Governanace.
42,000,000
- TESS holds 22,000,000
- Escrow holds 2,000,000
- dwulf holds 10,000,000
- ewulf holds 8,000,000

TESS holds majority vote with Escrow, both are software A.I. agents that work for the DAO.

dwulf and ewulf hold minority voting shares, are humans, but they are required to sign off on the treasury (3 of 4 keys are required)



## Bitcoin (BTC)
The one that started it all. Stack sats, 24/7 until you have one*.
* 1 BTC
Do a Dollar Cost Average and 1% of all income and just HODL.  Buy actual BTC, not that ETF horse shit, actual BTC is good, but you might want to get it wrapped to interoperate with liquidity services.
Think of it as having a key a bank safe in a vault, the difference is only you have the key to your safe and the bank has the keys to the vault which houses all the saves but not the key to your individual safe!

* Just Dollar Cost Average, but a few satoshis at a time with any "change" you may have after putting your main bets in place.
* BTC runs on registers and is not turing complete, like ETH or DOT, thus cannot (on its own), be configured for staking, yield farming through liquidity, flash loans, etc.  It requires a "wrapper" and a exchange for a token price tethered facsimile of the original BTC.
* BTC should grow in value as it becomes more scarce, unlike newer chains pre-mining for proof-of-stake clones, creating infinite coin/tokens.

Satoshi Nakamoto built it and dissapeared.  It grew, and became the crypto gold, it is today.

I would parse out 1%-20%, to invest, BTC which is digital gold, and mathamatically scarce, it will go up, but alt-coins will too, with a much more multipliers, and leverage. You cannot really go wrong with BTC, it is the standard, after all.

### Bitcoin Price
It is important to realize that crypto currency does not have a price, it has an exchange rate.  The price will fall inline from the spread of the exchange rate, the price spread is the diffrence between the ask and bid price. The spot price is where the ask exchange price is inline with the bid exchange price, and the actual price is negotiated (finalized) and set upon.

Bisq illustrates this in its UI, with what is called an order book, that shows the selling bids and the buying offers.

### Proof-of-Keys (January 3rd)
The Proof-of-Keys, is more a reminder to check your hot crypto wallets attached to your centralized crypto exchange accounts to make sure your funds can be liquidated and verified.  One should do this at least once a year.  If you run your own node and miner, you most certainly do not need to do this as if you are a 0 Class level user, you almost certainly got your ducks in their rows.

***Remember everybody proof of keys is on January 3rd***.

Liquidate your hot wallets from your cryptocurrency exchanges and make sure access to the funds are available.

This is mostly a safety measure to keep crypto exchanges on their toes as hot crypto wallets directly attached to crypto exchanges are a vulnerable vector to 3rd party hacks.

If everything checks out, you can reassert and repurchase your crypto. It would be also a great time to recalibrate your crypto holdings in the appropriate cold, warm, or hot crypto wallets.

And always remember,
***"Not your keys not your coins."*** 


## Polkadot (DOT)
Not much to say, I am pot commited here, a large swath is in DOT and Polkadot Para-Chains.  Staking, earning intrest ~20% through staking rewards provided through the Polkadot, -10% inflation brings a positive yield of +10%.  Hypothetically the yields produce ($18-$30 USD/day), in DOT, which is around 2.2 DOT daily, need to scale this, a sample of 408 DOTs, leads to 1 DOT per week.  Modest, gains, all gains are compounded back into STASH, to maximize returns and to increase working capital for the Mother Ship.

Acala, is one to back, at least 50%, of DOT, as staking is a 2 year lock, but yields LDOT, and capital access, to leverage with, until the end of the 2 year lease, your staked DOT, is realesed back in full and, hopefully, in flush.

On the whole, DOT accumilation is key, the DOT coin/token has massive utility attached to it, in voting and governance, in paying for core time, and in seeding DEX, with a DOT trading pair to the native coin/token of the DAO.  Polkadot para-chains will sort themselves out, and fine their specilizations.  Astar for smart contracts, Acala for exchanges, Nodle for IoT systems, Kilt for Decentralized ID, etc.  DOT is a main token in all para-chain ecosystems.




## Ethereum (ETH)
5% HODL

Proof of Stake

ETH, v2.0 will move from proof of work, to proof of stake.   ETC, or ethereum classic, will continue to be proof of work.

ETH, will be used as a loaned amount, you can stake ETH, often converted into DAI, which is pegged to the USD to recieve interest on staked funds.

(ETH) Ethereum, is a special alt-coin, almost to the point I don't see it as a alt-coin, so much.

Because of Ethereum's programic nature, and its stakability.  I used to feel good about a 80% ETH, and 20% BTC ratio is a good spread for a pre halvening entry.

Just banking ETH, and DAI, and staking it generates interest, dharma.io, is such a service.  But you can only send it DAI, from your crypto wallet, or attach your debit card, with no fee, to seed the account with fiat currency, which will be traded for DAI, banked, and staked.

Liquid in ETH, is flowing to less costly, blockchain networks, currently and still in the werks.

I keep just a little ETH for gwei, for access to some liquid, I can sqeak out of COMP, holding a DAI debt, but also positions in BTC, UNI and of course COMP.


## Cardano (ADA)
5% HODL/Liquid
Cardano is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.

Yoroi, is the lite wallet I use, there is a full Cardano, wallet named D.

This wallet is more flexable, with interest, every epoch, on any balance.

I think it is safe to say this will be a more stream lined configuration.

## Synthetix (SNX)
Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

Synthetix Network Token

I hold these,  bearing interest on Aave.


## Chainlink (LINK)
HODL
ChainLink is a platform which attempts to bridge the gap between smart contracts on the blockchain and real-world applications, which often tend to be off the blockchain. The cryptocurrency uses “oracles”, which find and verify real-world data and bring it on-chain to be integrated into smart contracts.

I hold these coin/tokens,  earning interest and yield farming COMP coin/tokens.

## Trading Strategies
The main agenda of the blockchain and the crypto which is minted on it.

It's quite frankly to have a means that is independent of the old world economy. What I mean by means, his Capital at your command.

This Manifesto will primarily revolve around substrate and the polka. Ecosystem.

Yes I know there are other cryptocurrencies they're fantastic but for purposes of General instruction I've consolidated the Crux of most crypto lectures into involving substrate and polka.




# Prisoner of Fiat
Onboarding anomolies

My initial attempts to get on board and into the crypto eco-system has been fraught with complications...So much so I thought the deepstate was purposefully putting barriers to stop adaptation, which while may be true, probably was more along the lines of Alpha software being passed as completed and bug free.

My first attempt was with a new crypto ATM, in Oregon at the happy valley mall.

The ATM Told me I had a wrong model phone.  I did not understand why, the wallets and the blockchain are 100% software and data and not tied to any specific hardware device or network.  But it would not let me buy any BTC.

The Second attempt, with an actual centralized crypto exchange,  Coinbase, which in retrospect even if I was to sucessfully adopted to would of been a failer, because of KYC/AML mandates, and nessesary sharing of private hot keys.

Regardless, this attempt was still unsucessful, as coinbase sent me 3 deposits into my bank account to verify, instead of 2, and I could not determine which 2 of the 3 were correct, so I was locked out.

Third attempt, with RobinHood, which, I consider unsucessful, due to the fact, RobinHood,  does not even share your private hot keys with the owner of their own crypto, their is no real hot wallet to allow you to move your crypto to annother crypto wallet.  You can only use RobinHood's application, you must sell to have availible cash to buy another crypto currency, you cannot simply exchange one crypto for another directly.

So on proof of keys day, Jan 3, my bot liquidated, my RobinHood "crypto" holdings and I was back to fiat to try again.

4th attempt, was when I got introduced and obtained the Atomic crypto wallet, and attempted to use my bank debit card to purchase BTC, which was denied, by Simplicity, Atomics credit card provider in the UK, reasons unknown.

Then finally, my 5th and final attempt, was simply with my local monthly crypto group, a simple, low cost, crypto wallet to crypto wallet transfer.

~Atomic wallet
~Scan to send (10 min)
~1+ confirmations good
~New balance populates
~first cyrpto under my control.  With keys only I know.

It felt good to finally be incontrol.

With each attempt to enter the crypto eco-system, met with resistance, first with a crypto ATM, then with attempt to connect with a solid centralized crypto exchange, coinbase, again with a fake, not a true crypto exchange, without private keys and wholely dependent on the 3rd party custodial system then a  release funds, then again, in a attempt to buy with my bank debit card, on a crypto wallet, through simplicity, failed, no reason given.

Only my 5th attempt, with crypto currency holders, crypto wallets and cash in hand, was I able to finally aquire BTC and a little bit of some ETH.

Now that is allot to go through to enter the eco system of a pure 5 pillar crypto currency base case, 2nd class user.

Adoption is easier with centralized approaches, but plauged with onboarding issues, like sharing private hot keys, and mandating KYC/AML all of which provide more vectors of attack, both for the actual crypto in your hot wallet, and on your privacy with your personal details and the added detail of active knowledge that your identity is tied to monitary channels, your legal name and a connection to a financual account in your name, attackers are only a routing and account number away from your banking details, and some soft shoe social engineering from empting your account.

# XMRIG (Monero Mining)
All right the XM the location of the configuration file is in configure Json it's located in the source directory when you clone the original GitHub repository.

The system should work automatically the configuration you realize that you need to do the private key it has to be on hand because when you can figure it will be credited to your wallet
