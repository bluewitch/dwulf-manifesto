# The GreenWitchDAO

The GreenWitchDAO is a self funding, self income generation system of finance embodied in the GreenWitchDAO system.  Built specifically to create optimum yield returns with automated A.I. guidance (specifically through SARA and BIANA).  Flashloans, staking, liquidity pools, yield farming, and other chain revenue generation methods are analysed through FARA, the oracle to impliment all strategies.
