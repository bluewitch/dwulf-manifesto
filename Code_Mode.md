# Code Mode

The is nothing new under the sun, everything in code and development is really just a more efficient way to develop and impliment code.  Stackoverflow and Google is your friend, keep your searching skills sharp.

Code Mode includes software Libraries and Frameworks allowing developers to impliment with fewer lines, working less with primitives and more with calling available libraries to do all the low level work such as managing the memory addresses and the respective literal values of primitives, and Frameworks which often times handles a whole new ecosystem, which sometimes have slightly nuanced syntax that require "transpilers" to interpret the syntax to JavaScript primitves in order to run correctly

## Testing and Debugging
Perhaps the most trying and tedious part of developing is testing and debugging the code itself.

When you write a implimentation of code, run it and it doesn't work, or doesn't work correctly or in the wost case works, seemingly works correctly, but is a ticking timebomb if you clobber a stray global varable with a name space you didn't know about.  Then Testing and debugging become a game changer.

I have often thought the term bug is a made up word to give developers a pass and to insulate themselves from unemployment.  Just blame the bug, the glitch, the Unknown Anomaly.

The key is to find the bugs quickly by diagnosing the error message.

## 0(n) Algorthms
Big O operations, and the time scale of functions, specifcally for searching and sifting through data.

I know that the big O can be intiminating  but do not let this be daunting to you.  Yes it is math, function, but this math function is also the core in understanding diffrent levels of compexity with programming functions.

### Upper Bound
- O(n2)   Bubble sort, Selection sort
- O(n log n) Merge sort
- O(n) Linear search
- O(log n) Binary search
- O(1)

### Lower Bound
- Omega(n2) Bubble sort, Selection sort
- Omega(n log n) Merge sort
- Omega(n)
- Omega(log n)
- Omega(1) Linear search, Binary search

### Upper and Lower
- Theta(n2) Selection sort
- Theta(n log n) Merge sort
- Theta(n)
- Theta(log n)
- Theta(1)


Thats the math of code.  If it is still a bit much to grok, just take it day by day, and talk about it to your ducky.
