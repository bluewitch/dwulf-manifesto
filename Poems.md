## DOT A Lot

I dot allot
With all my dots

It's locked into my hash,
An ever growing stash,
Of all my crypto cash,
While the shitcoins only crash.


Collator holds the details,
that are put upon the node.
buying money that retails,
Shopping DOT abode.

chorus:
Validators, nominators checking all the blocks,
Lambda running automators,
Cashing in the stocks.

Keeping daily rhythm by crunching all the numbers,
and the nightly calculations
while the earth just slumbers.
chorus:

So I have a hash,
that represents my cash,
hidden in my stash,
controlled by scripts in bash.

The money I am making,
I keep the nightly spread.
the IRS not taking,
All my daily bread.

The SEC keeps squawking,
behind their close door meetings.
The regulators talking,
to give Binance their beatings.

keeping off their radar,
is really half the fun.
We play them like a guitar,
as we ready later one.

We engineer the blockchain,
to decouple from banks.
To opt out of the pain,
and avoid their guns and tanks.

Money is still money,
the digits spend like cash.
We cultivate that honey,
and we dump the shit that's trash.

We find correct translation,
blockchain hashes day and night.
To discover our creation,
while the Oracle giving sight.

The bot just knows the numbers,
as the markets exchange the price.
A hash will take all commers,
just 32bit, is nice.

When KYC is not for thee,
puts more vectors on your coin.
The wallet you create is free,
only 1 vector,  the blockchain you join.

keep it secret, keep it safe,
trust the code correct.
The blockchains gears will never chafe,
and testing will inspect.
