***Self-custody Crypto Wallets:***

A self-custody crypto wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where you have full control over the private keys and, consequently, your digital assets. In other words, you 'custodize' or maintain custody of your own funds. This is in contrast to custodial wallets, where a third party, such as an exchange or a wallet service, keeps the keys for you. The key advantage of a self-custody wallet is that you have full control over your funds, reducing the risk of third-party breaches. However, it also means you're responsible for the security and backup of your wallet keys.

***Running DeFi Exchanges:***

Running a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) exchange involves maintaining a platform that uses blockchain technology to eliminate intermediaries and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions. DeFi exchanges, also known as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), allow for the trading of digital assets directly from wallet to wallet, without the need for a centralized authority. As such, the role involves ensuring the functionality, security, and integrity of the DeFi exchange platform. It might also entail facilitating liquidity provision, order matching, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

***Running Validators:***

Validators play a crucial role in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Validators are nodes that are chosen to create a new block and validate transactions within that block on the blockchain. The process of running a validator involves maintaining a node, staking a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral, and performing actions necessary to validate transactions, such as verifying the validity of signatures and ensuring transactions do not double spend. Validators earn rewards for their work, but they can also lose (or 'be slashed') their staked collateral if they validate fraudulent transactions or fail to stay online and perform their role.

***Running Collators:***

In a blockchain network like Polkadot, collators serve a significant function. A collator's primary role is to maintain a full node of a specific parachain (a simpler form of blockchain, attached to the central Relay Chain), collect and execute transactions in that parachain, and produce new block candidates for validators' approval. They collate (thus, the term 'collator') information from their specific parachain and pass it to the Relay Chain, allowing for inter-chain communication and scalability.

***Running Nodes:***

Running nodes is fundamental to the operation and security of a blockchain network. A node is essentially a computer that holds a copy of the blockchain and follows the rules of the network. There are different types of nodes, including full nodes that store the entire history of a blockchain and validate all rules of the network, and lightweight or 'SPV' nodes that only download a fraction of the blockchain. Running a node involves maintaining the hardware and network connection necessary to keep the node online, keeping the blockchain data up-to-date by synchronizing with the rest of the network, and validating and relaying transactions or blocks according to the rules of the blockchain protocol. Running nodes helps decentralize the network, contributing to its security and robustness.

The pure essence of hacking, reformatted, refined, and distilled.

Had to unlearn, and then relearn; the brutal truth is never a lie.

BASH scripting `.sh`, need to own and make executable.
