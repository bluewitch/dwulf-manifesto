There is a Rule of Law, but it is too slow and too buracratic.  By the time we compile a new dApp and run its smart contract,
the Rule of Law was involved in...co-chairing the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation is in...they kept it gray.</p>

You don't have to understand how the computer works; you just need to know how to work with it.

## First Principles
- Code primitives and first principles in BASH, JavaScript(NPM), Python(PIP3), and Rust(CARGO).  
- A clear understanding of primitives, `char`, `int`, etc. and the algorthms and code base.
- Git fluency (all common  comands).  `git add .`,`git commit -m "message here"`,`git push`, `git pull`, 
- Linux fluency with administration of NixOS, Ubuntu(Debian), Kali

## The Hard Stuff
- Daily Driver (code named: Stormbringer / Darkstar): Legion Pro 5 (Windows/Linux)
- Mobile (code named: Shadow Caster): Samsung s23 Ultra (Android)
- Hardware devices(Microprocessors): Raspberry Pi MyNode (code named: Demeter).
- Hardware Hacking Tools (BadUSB, WiFi, Network): RubberDucky (BadUSB), Malduino, Pineapple
- Drone devices: DJI Pro (thought and memory)

## Meta Machines
- Optimized configurations (aliases, BASH)
- Libraries/frameworks: NPM, Cargo, PIP, GraphQL, REST, gRPC
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes.

## Blockchain/Crypto (Avado Metal)

- Self-custody Crypto Wallets:
- Running DeFi Exchanges:
- Running Validators:
- Running Collators:
- Running Nodes:

## Health
- Diet, exercise, and sleep.

The pure essence of hacking, reformatted, refined, and distilled.

Had to unlearn, and then relearn; the brutal truth is never a lie.

BASH scripting `.sh`, need to own and make executable.
