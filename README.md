## First Principles
- Code primitives and first principles in JavaScript, Python, and Rust.  
- A clear understanding of the algorthm and code base.
- Git fluency (all common  comands)
- Linux fluency with administration of NixOS, Ubuntu, Kali

## The Hard Stuff
- Adroid devices, Mobile
- Hardware devices, Microprocessors, Raspberry Pi.
- Drone devices, DJI

## Meta Machines
- Optimized configurations (aliases, BASH)
- Libraries/frameworks: GraphQL, REST, gRPC
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes.

## Blockchain/Crypto (Avado Metal)
- Self-custody crypto wallets, 
- Running DeFi exchanges
- Running Validators
- Running Coallators 
- Running Nodes

## Health
- Diet, exercise, and sleep.
