People often perceive me as standoffish, keeping to myself, and anti-social. While there is some truth to that, I choose to be selective in my social interactions, preferring to spend time with people I deem worthy, even if it means being alone.

I am wary of getting involved in trivial dramas that resemble cackling hens, as they only bring disharmony, senseless arguments, and waste valuable time that can never be reclaimed. Tempus fugit. (time flies)

It has been said that I build emotional walls, barricading myself and ignoring certain people. This is true to an extent, as I protect my heart and mind from emotional vampirism and the erosion of my personal and intellectual integrity. Some may take offense to this and express dissenting opinions about me.

To them, I say:
"Wolves don't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep."

You don't have to understand how the computer works; you just need to know how to work with it.

## First Principles
- Code primitives and first principles in JavaScript, Python, and Rust.  
- A clear understanding of the algorthm and code base.
- Git fluency (all common  comands)
- Linux fluency with administration of NixOS, Ubuntu, Kali

## The Hard Stuff
- Adroid devices, Mobile
- Hardware devices, Microprocessors, Raspberry Pi.
- Drone devices, DJI

## Meta Machines
- Optimized configurations (aliases, BASH)
- Libraries/frameworks: GraphQL, REST, gRPC
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes.

## Blockchain/Crypto (Avado Metal)
- Self-custody crypto wallets, 
- Running DeFi exchanges
- Running Validators
- Running Coallators 
- Running Nodes

## Health
- Diet, exercise, and sleep.

The pure essence of hacking, reformatted, refined, and distilled.

Had to unlearn, and then relearn; the brutal truth is never a lie.

BASH scripting `.sh`, need to own and make executable.
