People tell me that I am standoffish, keep to myself and anti-social.   They are only half correct.   I really choose to be social with people I deem worthy of my time, even if it is only myself.

I don't want my mind tainted with the trivial dramas of people that remind me of cackling hens whom often invoke disharmony, foolish arguments and ultimately the precious loss of time that is wasted, time irretrievable. Tempus fugit. (time flies)

I have been told that I put up walls, emotional barricades and flat out ignore certain people...This is true, I guard my heart and mind from the emotional vampirism  and the dumbing down of my personhood and intellectual integrity.   This only seems to anger certain people and have them give dissenting opinions of me.

And to that I say this,
"Wolves don't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep"



You don't have to know how the computer works, just how to work the computer.

## First Principles
(code primitives, JavaScript, Python, and Rust)

## The Hard Stuff
(Hardware devices, Raspberry Pi)

## Meta Machines
(Libraries/frameworks, Git, Docker, K8, GraphQL)

## Blockchain/Crypto
(Self-custody crypto wallets, exchanges, mining, nodes)

## Health
(diet, exersize, and sleep)


The pure extract of all hacking, reformatted, refined, and distilled. 

Had to unlearn, and then relearn, the brutal truth is never a lie.

BASH scripting `.sh`, need to own and make executable
