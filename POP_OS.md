# Pop it up

I had my Ubuntu system crash and was able to salvage my Obsidian notes all in markdown, booted into a new POP OS, and it is working like a charm.

In a terminal write

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

# Rust install
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

# Install NPM (Node Packet Manager)


# Install Python 3
```bash
Always draw your curves, then plot your reading.
```
