# Game Theory
I play games, it sharpens the creative mind and helps me think on how to solve real-world problems.
RPGs are my favorite, but I also enjoy the first person adventure shooter also.

## Space
- Star Citizen
- - The first and most expesive first date dissapointment, perpetually in Beta and always under construction, (but isn't all software that way?).  Jokes aside...It's getting better
- Eilte Dangerous
- - They got a whole virtual Galaxy, and it is a whole lot of nothing, but mostly empty space.  Most of the action is in the bubble and you must grind to get the good stuff.
- Starfield
- - Just out, to be released in Sept 2023, can't wait, and yes I did pre order, the premium edition, mostly for the DLC
