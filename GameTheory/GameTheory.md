# Game Theory
I play games, it sharpens the creative mind and helps me think on how to solve real-world problems.
RPGs are my favorite, but I also enjoy the first person adventure shooter also.

## Space
- Star Citizen
- - The first and most expesive first date dissapointment, perpetually in Beta and always under construction, (but isn't all software that way?).  I think I bled about $600 on my ships, but haven't been too involved as moding is not all there.  Jokes aside...It's getting better
- Eilte Dangerous
- - They got a whole virtual Galaxy, and it is a whole lot of nothing, but mostly empty space.  Most of the action is in the bubble and you must grind to get the good stuff.  Took a trip to the A* primodial blackhole in the center of the galaxy, but if you have seen one blackhole you seen them all.  Blackhole effects just overheat and destroy the ship.
- Starfield
- - Just out, to be released in Sept 2023, can't wait, and yes I did pre order, the premium edition, mostly for the DLC Shatered Space, I am looking forward to this one, single player, very modable, and a Bethesda game to boot, the same Todd that brought us SKyrim, and Fallout.

## RPG Cyberpunk
- CyberPunk 2077
- - This is the only Cyberpunk game I am very much into, but I played this so many times already, just waiting for the DLC, to rescue the president.

## RPG Fantasy
- Skyrim
- - What can I say, this is the D&D simulator the way the Gods meant it to be, with Mods you can turn this into a perfect setting for mini-movies and media.

## Tarot
Show the scary Tarot cards,
or throw them to the wind.

Your fate is tied to the song of bards,
and to every mortal sin.

Both high and low arcana magick,
will weave your tale of fate.
how love could be so tradgic,
and the truth cannot relate.

The cards they have no meaning,
once they tell their story.
from a vision you are weaning,
a hint of fortune and glory.

You still must know your craft,
your tools sharpened and oiled.
