# Taxes and how to avoid, not evade them.

"Tax is the price you pay to live in civilization."
~Joe Tax Payer


## IRS, the tax scam authority

In US, the IRS will require all US citizens reporting all Bitcoin or any crypto-currency gains.

Will this stop you from using crypto-currency or investing in it?

If you are a citizen of the US Sovereign nation-state, you will be subject to the pure extortion methods of the IRS, as they have the capability to freeze your personal account holdings, seize your persoal assets in your name, garnish your personal income, put a lien on your personal property and vehicles.

As a consiquence it is strategically preferable to "own" nothing in your name, not even crypto but still have the capability to control your wealth.

The problem is IRS has such draconian,  nonsensical, and idiotic rules on crypto currencies that it is near impossible for the average citizen to comply. Moreover the IRS has created such arbitrary regulations of how crypto currencies are taxed with so caÄºled "taxable events", that determine when they are taxed.

The fact that they are taxed in a diffrent and more cumbersome way than, fiat and conventional capital investments, like property, stocks, bonds, mutual funds to make it a disadvantage and a slight liability to own or trade with any crypto.

The reason why it's a slight liability is because the onus is on the US citizen cryptocurrency user to produce reliable and accurate data on every cryptocurrency transaction.   Failure to do so will result in a IRS audit and harsh penalties.

If there are any inaccuracies, or mistakes from purposeful or accidental means, that may result in a severe penalty and possible prison time.

Interestingly, it should be noted all the traditional  and conventional capital investments have one thing in common that crypto currency and Bitcoin does not.

They are always tehered to your legal personal legal identity.  

Either by KYC or AML, that is required by default when you open up any modern and regulated bank account. Or by your personal social security number, required for W2 employment which serves as a numeric index that the IRS can use to identify you personally and determine monies paid to you through labour.

# Tax Rant
And here we go again...

The typical tax rant, you want police and Emergency Services don't you, you want to help the poor and mentally ill don't you, you want to educate our citizens don't you.

To that I say have some fucking accountability.

Yes I want police, that are agents of Justice, and not just agents of the state and the wealthy.

Yes, I want actual emergency services, that include the services I would actually use in an emergency, like an ambulance ride to the hospital ( a reasonably priced ambulance ride.)

Helping the poor and mentally ill, absolutely! Just stop cutting all the social services for the mentally ill you "Joker"

What is the fair tax solution?

First off, income tax is off the table. Every citizen is entitled to 100% of their income. Abolish the IRS. No more automatic tax deductions from your paycheck. Giving the tax authorities an interest-free loan for a year.

I hear you saying, what about all the amazing services that we get like the prison industrial complex, or the military industrial complex, and the banking industrial complex which for some reason can't be allowed to fail.

VAT taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and even contributing voluntary taxes for the things that we all care about.  When you consume with your 100% tax free wealth, you pay a premium to contribute to what you consume. 

Buy a house, you pay property taxes, for local communities, schools and such.

Buy a car, you pay the VAT for roads and bridges.

Buy food, sales tax for the health inspector, etc.

Fuck the just pay your taxes mantra.  Show us your books, and we the people, not the lobyst and polititions will decide what is important enough to opt-in to, and what is to opt-out of. 
Crypto and Bitcoin, specifically the creation of crypto warm and cold wallets, initially does not, mandate this.  This may not be so for hot crypto wallets created on regulated centralized crypto exchanges.

Unless you opt-into sharing your personal information, by submitting KYC/AML to the regulated centralized crypto exchanges that require the user to do so in order to use the crypto exchange services.

If you want total privacy, it is best to be able to control crypto assets, without formally "owning" them in your personal name.

The irony is, now, you in fact are able to control and use cyrpto assets without formally owning them.

Much the same way that a hacker or software bot, that has root access to your computing device is able to control your computing device even though you own it.

This has been done before, in the real world by lawyers and business men, creating and instantiating other legal entities, sometimes called LLCs, or Corporations.

But even these legal entities,  are beholden to the city-states laws, and bylaws where they are incepted.

Decentralized crypto, is immune to this, by not initailly being pair-bonded to a legal entity, or any citizen ID, and being, initailly, completely unknown to any tax authority.

The code is not beholden to any one, except the holder of the private key of the wallet.

And it is at this point, crypto is trully seperated from church and state.


# Chainalysis, hired thug of the IRS



Money Laundering in Cryptocurrency

A few years back, the IRS hired a third party validation company called chainalaysis, its contract was to monitor trades on the centralized crypto exchanges, and match them with us tax paying citizens to determine the ownership of crypto wallets and the respective user accounts on the pseudo anonymous  blockchain platform.

Governmental agencies and regulators mandated know your customer and anti-money laundering rules, also known as KYC/AML mandates.

Which required all users on centralized and officialy regulated and sanctioned platforms to identify themselves with governmental issued IDs and a picture of themselves in order to use the services of the centralized crypto exchange.

Exchanges that failed to comply, we're shut down by law enforcement agencies.

Because of the nature of this some cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance were forced to geo-block US citizens temporarily freezing them out of their accounts, until another clone site, creativly called, Binance US, (how orignial) could be created to deal with the specific mandated arbitrary regulations set forth by the United States government.

In the end, Binance simply excluded US citizens from its servers and services, forcing users in the US to withdraw their funds, or create new accounts through VPNs to continue to trade through Binance.

The consiquences of this act gave leverage to the SEC regulators, the IRS, and other governmental legal factions. To subpoena, at will, and for any reason, all personal user information and their respective trades on the crypto exchange platform.

KYC/AML would also give Chainalysis, a indexing starting point to trace all crypto trades provided thru KYC and AML mandates and the information of the users provided.


This is why, with the same complications of keeping personal private data, private is becoming even more complicated.

With USDT, ( tether ), under fire, from the SEC, and the courts, stable coins, that can be seized are no diffrent than fiat accounts that can be frozen, at will, for any reason to let the courts hash it out and decide if you get your money or not.
