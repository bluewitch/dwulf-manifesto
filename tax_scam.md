# Taxes and how to avoid, not evade them.

## IRS, the tax scam authority

In US, the IRS will require all US citizens reporting all Bitcoin or any crypto-currency gains.

Will this stop you from using crypto-currency or investing in it?

If you are a citizen of the US Sovereign nation-state, you will be subject to the pure extortion methods of the IRS, as they have the capability to freeze your personal account holdings, seize your persoal assets in your name, garnish your personal income, put a lien on your personal property and vehicles.

As a consiquence it is strategically preferable to "own" nothing in your name, not even crypto but still have the capability to control your wealth.

The problem is IRS has such draconian,  nonsensical, and idiotic rules on crypto currencies that it is near impossible for the average citizen to comply. Moreover the IRS has created such arbitrary regulations of how crypto currencies are taxed with so caÄºled "taxable events", that determine when they are taxed.

The fact that they are taxed in a diffrent and more cumbersome way than, fiat and conventional capital investments, like property, stocks, bonds, mutual funds to make it a disadvantage and a slight liability to own or trade with any crypto.

The reason why it's a slight liability is because the onus is on the US citizen cryptocurrency user to produce reliable and accurate data on every cryptocurrency transaction.   Failure to do so will result in a IRS audit and harsh penalties.

If there are any inaccuracies, or mistakes from purposeful or accidental means, that may result in a severe penalty and possible prison time.

Interestingly, it should be noted all the traditional  and conventional capital investments have one thing in common that crypto currency and Bitcoin does not.

They are always tehered to your legal personal legal identity.  

Either by KYC or AML, that is required by default when you open up any modern and regulated bank account. Or by your personal social security number, required for W2 employment which serves as a numeric index that the IRS can use to identify you personally and determine monies paid to you through labour.

Crypto and Bitcoin, specifically the creation of crypto warm and cold wallets, initially does not, mandate this.  This may not be so for hot crypto wallets created on regulated centralized crypto exchanges.

Unless you opt-into sharing your personal information, by submitting KYC/AML to the regulated centralized crypto exchanges that require the user to do so in order to use the crypto exchange services.

If you want total privacy, it is best to be able to control crypto assets, without formally "owning" them in your personal name.

The irony is, now, you in fact are able to control and use cyrpto assets without formally owning them.

Much the same way that a hacker or software bot, that has root access to your computing device is able to control your computing device even though you own it.

This has been done before, in the real world by lawyers and business men, creating and instantiating other legal entities, sometimes called LLCs, or Corporations.

But even these legal entities,  are beholden to the city-states laws, and bylaws where they are incepted.

Decentralized crypto, is immune to this, by not initailly being pair-bonded to a legal entity, or any citizen ID, and being, initailly, completely unknown to any tax authority.

The code is not beholden to any one, except the holder of the private key of the wallet.

And it is at this point, crypto is trully seperated from church and state.
